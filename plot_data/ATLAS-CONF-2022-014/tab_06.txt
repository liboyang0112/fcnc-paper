Predicted and observed yields in each of the analysis regions considered. The background prediction is shown after a background-only fit to data. Also shown are the signal expectations for tt&#772; &rarr; WbHc and tt&#772; &rarr; WbHu assuming mathscrB(t&rarr; cH)=0.1% and mathscrB(t&rarr; uH)=0.1% respectively. The contributions with real &tau;<sub>had</sub> candidates from tt&#772; and  Z&rarr; &#8467;<sup>+</sup>&#8467;<sup>-</sup> (&#8467; = e, &mu;), diboson, tt&#772; V, tt&#772; H, single-top-quark, and other small backgrounds are combined into a single background source referred to as ``Other MC" in the leptonic channels , whereas single-top-quark and the small contributions are combined into ``Rare" in the hadronic channels. The quoted uncertainties are the sum in quadrature of statistical and systematic uncertainties of the yields.
