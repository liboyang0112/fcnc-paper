Leading &tau;<sub>had</sub> p<sub>T</sub>  distributions obtained before the fit to data (``Pre-Fit") showing the expected background and tuH signals after applying fake factors in the following SRs: t<sub>&#8467;</sub>&tau;had&tau;had (a), t<sub>&#8467;</sub>&tau;had-1j (b),  t<sub>&#8467;</sub>&tau;had-2j (c), t<sub>h</sub>&tau;lep&tau;had-2j (d), t<sub>h</sub>&tau;lep&tau;had-3j (e), t<sub>h</sub>&tau;had&tau;had-2j (f), and t<sub>h</sub>&tau;had&tau;had-3j (g). The total size of the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the background prediction is indicated by the hatched band.  Overflow events are included in the last bin. ``Other MC" (``Rare") includes single top, and V+jets and other small backgrounds in the leptonic (hadronic) channel. The tuH signal is scaled using a normalization factor of 2 to 50.  The lower panels show the data to prediction ratio.
