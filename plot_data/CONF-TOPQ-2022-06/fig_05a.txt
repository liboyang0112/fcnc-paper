95% CL upper limits (a) on the plane of mathscrB(t&rarr; uH) versus mathscrB(t&rarr; cH) and (b) on the plane of C<sub>c&phi;</sub> versus C<sub>u&phi;</sub> for the combination of the searches. The observed limits (solid lines) are compared with the expected (median) limits under the background-only hypothesis (dotted lines). The surrounding shaded bands correspond to the 68% and 95% CL intervals around the expected limits, denoted by &plusmn; 1&sigma; and &plusmn; 2&sigma;, respectively.
