95% CL upper limits on mathscrB(t&rarr; cH)(a) for the individual searches as well as their combination, assuming mathscrB(t&rarr; uH)=0. 95% CL upper limits on mathscrB(t&rarr; uH)(b) for the individual searches as well as their combination, assuming mathscrB(t&rarr; cH)=0. The observed limits (solid lines) are compared with the expected (median) limits under the background-only hypothesis (dotted lines). The surrounding shaded bands correspond to the 68% and 95% CL intervals around the expected limits, denoted by &plusmn; 1&sigma; and &plusmn; 2&sigma;, respectively.
