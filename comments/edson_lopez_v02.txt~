Dear FCNC tqH (tautau) team,
Thanks for your first draft! Below please find some comments on version 0.2. (of 2nd of February)
Cheers,
Edson

==> Thanks for your excellent comments

L 7-9.- A search for flavour-changing neutral currents (tqH) involving a top quark, an up-type quark q (with q = u,c), and a Standard Model Higgs boson decaying into a tau lepton pair (H->tau+tau-) is presented.

L304.- Section 5.2 should be part of the Analysis Strategy IMO, also you can change the name to “Estimation of backgrounds with misidentified final state particles” or shorter “Estimation of reducible background contributions”…
==> The background estimation is restructured and moved into a a new section after the Analysis Strategy.
