FCNC PAPER DRAFT 0.2 2022-02-03

Thanks for the updated draft. I had a few additional comments on sections 7-10 of DRAFT 0.2 to post.
For the next draft, please provide a latex-diff wrt v0.2 draft to reduce the iteration time.

* Fig.1: Signal is invisible in the plot. Can you show as a line on the same canvas and rescale it 
by a large factor and put it in the legend, e.g. tuH 10xB=0.1% (if BR is 0.1% and is scaled by a factor 10).
==> 

* Fig 1 caption: V → $V$, same for ttbar. You can remove (“Data”) and (“Bkg.”) and add a “.” at the 
end of the text.
==> done

* l458: please use “l” or “\ell” consistently throughput the paper and define it in Section 4.

* l465: pT → write in latex format.

* l496: Twice m_top → m_t as for the rest of the paper

* l504: This is not clear, is the uncertainty estimated with a 30% uncertainty or the value of 
the uncertainty is about 30%? Clarify.

* l512: Why VH samples are not discussed? Are you using VH samples in the analysis? If not, why?
==> added 

* Tab 6-7: they should be referenced in this section (they are referenced later). Please review the names of 
the uncertainties in the tables carefully, comparing with other top group papers. The names of the 
uncertainties should be improved. “Instrument” is not used elsewhere. Jet, Met, \tau are not uncertainties, 
please write the uncertainties names correctly. Also fix the latex in several places. Put “Other” theory 
uncertainties after ttbar. Also put Statistical Uncertainty after the Total Systematic Uncertainty.
The uncertainties that are shown are prefit or postfit? Are they expected uncertainties or observed 
uncertainties? Both clarifiations should be written. If it is from the fit, you should forward reference 
that the uncertainties are derived from the statistical signal fit described in Section 8. Does it make 
sense to show the impact as an impact on mu if there is no statistical excess? Why not impact on the limit? 
Why are you not showing a single table with the uncertainties from the full combination?
==> 

* l526: I can’t find anywhere that the final discriminant is the MVA distribution. You should start by 
saying that here, if not written previously.
==> 

* l542: mock → pseudo

* l570: could also quote the combined significance? If we are looking for a tuH signal, then all 
categories contribute.

* l571: I would remove this sentence, because it is too vague.

Fig2,3,4: I think that you should have only one of those figures in the paper, I suggest Fig4: postfit tHu. 
The other two can go in aux material.
Can you make the figure larger as Fig1? For signal, please use a continuous and thicker line. 
I think you should mention for Fig2a that the last points in the ratio plots are outside the range 
(you could also add arrows to point that the points are off scale). You could remove the grid from 
fig2 bottom pad. The caption of the figures has to be expanded, like fig1. Clarify which signal 
and scaling is used in figures 3 and 4.
==>


* Fig3,4 captions: remove “being” before shown.
==> fixed 

* l575: space between “, assuming”

* l575: The sensitivity of the leptonic channels is a factor of two….
==> fixed 

* l578: This paragraph should be in the systematics section.

* l582: “Tables” 6-7.

* Eq 3 and l592: I think it should be C_q\phi everywhere and not C_u\phi.

* l588: add space between “1, 2”.

* Table 8: replace 0(0) with “--”. Please fix the latex of several samples. There are too many lines, 
try to merge. Also Lep Fakes, Double fakes b Fakes are not well defined in the paper, so merge all of them.
==>

* Table9 and Fig 5 are repeating the same information, right? I recommend to put the table in backup and keep 
the figure. I think you should also show the bestfit values. Can you please add those? Also, I definitely 
think that you should have in both the figure and table the limits for each individual channel on the top, 
then the Leptonic combined, Hadronic and finally all combined.
==>


* L603: space production mode (pp → …).

* l607: jets. Multivariate.

* l609: of “Run 2” data. Also add here the improvements with respect to the previous paper, both in terms of 
analysis (additional channels, techniques, etc.) and in terms of sensitivity.

Thanks!
