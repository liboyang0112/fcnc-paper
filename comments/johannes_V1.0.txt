Dear all,
paper draft v1.0 is in good shape. I leave a couple of suggestions here and am looking forward to discussing tomorrow in the EB meeting.
Best
Johannes

==> thank you so much

Title suggestion: “Search for flavour-changing neutral current tqH of the top quark and the Higgs boson…” -> 
“Search for flavour-changing neutral-current interactions of the top quark and the Higgs boson…” 
(this avoid defining the symbol “tqH” in the title); to be discussed with the EB of course
==> fixed 

l.22: Often in FCNC searches, we don’t give the limits on the Wilson coefficients, because they depend 
on the choice for Lambda. If you want to quote them, I suggest adding that this is for Lambda = 1 TeV.
==> added as "for the new physics scale $\Lambda$ at 1~TeV,"

l.52: I suggest to note quote the Snowmass ’13 report here. The idea for the t->qH decay 
did not originate there. I think the sentence is ok w/o the reference.
==> agreed, but it's still useful to quota the reference as a new beginning.   

l.347-349: You say that the Higgs and top four-momentum resolutions are improved by the chi2 fit. 
Does this refer to all 4 components of the four-momentum? Or just to the pT or just to the invariant mass? I suggest to spell this out explicitly.
==> yes, it's pt after including the missing neutrinos from the fit.
    rephased "...the Higgs boson pT as well as the pT of the parent top quark are..."
    
l.355: I suggest “Boosted decisions trees (BDT) *implemented in the TMVA framework* [96]”, 
as otherwise it might look like that BDTs originate from TMVA.
==> fixed

Table 5: How did you order the variables? Could you order them (roughly) in importance?
==> based on their improtance in each SR, and it would be difficult to order cross SRs.

Figure 1: I believe that this figure would be better suited at the end of Section 7, i.e. 
after all the different backgrounds are introduced and defined.
==> It would be good to have BDT training and modeling issues discussed together. Maybe we need
    to move section 6.2 after the background discussion. 
    

l.458: I suggest to stay in passive voice here for consistency: “FFs obtained from the …. were compared and the differences are 
treated as a systematic uncertainty.”
==>fixed 

Table 6: As this table uses the fit to SRs already, it should go to the results section, I believe.
==> Yes, the table 6 is introduced in results, but the table self is in a wrong place.
    fixed
    

Table 6: “Met” -> “\MET”
==>fixed 

Table 6: I suggest to change the ordering a bit and group the different rows so that similar uncertainties are 
close to each other. For example: First objects (lepton, MET, Jets, flavor tagging), then background modelling 
(theoretical uncertainty in ttbar, theoretical uncertainty in other MC, misidentified tau) and theoretical 
uncertainty in signal, hadronic tau decays and lumi+pileup.
==> ordered as suggested 

l.596: “We have checked…” -> “The kinematic distributions... were checked...”
==>fixed 

l.596: Maybe mention the split by years that you did, too, saying that there is no indication that the excess is from a specific data period?
==> added. 

Fig. 2 b3 and c1: Please fix the layout of the figure (no overlapping legend with the histograms,
in particular) and adjust the aspect ratio and style to the one of the other figures.
==> Will fix. 

Figures 2-4: The information content of figures 3 and 4 is very similar to the content of figure 2. 
Why not just keep Fig. 3 (or 4) and add Fig. 2 and 4 (or 3) to the aux. material?
==> Will discuss at EB

Figures 2-4: Out of curiosity: Why is the binning different in the leptonic channels in Fig. 2 
compared to Fig. 3 & 4? The same binning is used in the two fits, isn’t it?
==> Will fix 

l.611: There is an error in the reference “Tables 6-??” to be fixed.
==> fixed

l.614-623: I think you need to specify somewhere here what value of Lambda you choose. I assume it’s 1 TeV. Is it?
==> added 

Fig. 5: I suggest to remove the grey vertical line (which is the previous limit, right?) from the plots.
==> will fix

Fig. 5: The plots should say “95% CL limit” somewhere on the plot, maybe just on the x-axis label or directly on the plots as you do for Fig. 6.
==> will fix 

Table 7: Please verify if this table needs to be updated (as the caption says).
==> will check 

l.631: “following SM processes” -> “according to the SM”
==> fixed

l.638: Suggest to stay in passive voice here for consistency: “We set 95% CL uppes limits…” -> “95% CL upper limits are set…”
==> fixed

l.634: I suggest to add here also that Lambda = 1 TeV (as in the abstract)
==> added
