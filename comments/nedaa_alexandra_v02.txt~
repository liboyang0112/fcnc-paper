Dear FCNC tqH (tautau) team, 

Thanks for your first draft! Below please find some comments on version 0.2. 

Cheers,
     Nedaa-Alexandra 

==> Thank you so much for sending these detailed comments, which are very helpful. 
 

- General comment: 
    - either use MC after you first define it or write out Monte Carlo

==> fixed  

- Detailed comments:
- Remove the empty page 3
==> fixed 

- Line 10: remove "CERN" I think it is enough to say "recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron..."
==> fixed 

- Line 16-17: Perhaps say something like "XX, XX and event kinematics are used to separate signal from the background through a multivariate discriminant"
==> fixed 

- Line 25: Since the observation of Higgs boson by >> After the discovery of the Higgs boson [XX] in 2012 by the ATLAS [X] and CMS [X] collaborations,..."
==> fixed

- Line 36: Need a reference for 2HDM
==> ?

- Line 54: 36.1~fb^{-1} should be all on the same line
==> fixed

- Line 61: space in "36.1fb^{-1}"
==> fixed

- Line 68: This paper is focused on the decay mode ... >>The analysis targets Higgs-boson decays to -leptons using the...
==> fixed

- Line 70-72: The sentence is too long. Perhaps break it down into two sentences?
==> fixed

- Line 73: space after lepton "lepton(electron"
==> fixed

- Line 81: No need to have a separate paragraph. Consider merging this sentence with the above paragraph
==> fixed 

- Line 105: No need for a new paragraph
==> fixed

- Line 108: Slightly unusual way to start this section. Here is a suggestion: "Events are selected from pp collisions at sqrt(s)=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector during 2015-2018. Only events for which all relevant subsystems were operational are considered. Events are required to have at least one vertex with two or more tracks with transverse momentum..."
==> Thanks for the suggestion

- Line 125-127: Maybe this sentence is better after you describe the triggers. Maybe in section 4
==> moved to section 4

- Line 134: based a trained >>based on a trained
==> fixed 
- Line 134: Are you using the correct PLIV dedicated scale factors? These Scale factors were recently provided and they are only available for FS samples. Is this okay for you?
==> Yes, we have checked PLIV SF using Z->ll events from ttHWML samples, which agree with data.

- Line 140: Rephrase the sentence "These scale factors are also checked applicable to the electron or muon"o be applicable? 
==>rephased

- Line 141: Do not use "we".Maybe you can say something like this: "An additional uncertainty of +-2% is considered.."
==> fixed

- Line 159-160: You need a reference
==> add DL1r btag reference

- Line 173: Perhaps start the paragraph with something like this: "To avoid counting a single detector response as more than one lepton or jet, an overlap removal procedure..." instead of "Overlaps between reconstructed objects are removed sequentially..."
==> rephased

- Line 207: Avoid having short sentences in separate paragraphs
==> merged 

- Line 220 & 341: I find it strange to use "trailing"
==> replaced with "subleading"

- Table two : Did you define "TT Signal", "ST Signal", "ME", and "PS" in the text? If not, you can explain them in the caption
==> replaced "TT Signal" with tt(qH), "ST Signal " with tH. "ME" for Matrix-element and "PS" for parton shower 

- Line 309: You need a reference after "proved by monte carlo studies" otherwise you need to rephrase this sentence. Also you can use MC or write out "Monte Carlo"
==> rephased 

- Line 311: Maybe add a reference to the ABCD method if there is one
==> Add the explanation what ABCD method does and hopefully it's clear. 

- Line 312: remove "which is widely used in ATLAS physics analyses."
==> fixed
- Line 320: monte carlo >> Monte Carlo (and everywhere in the note)
==> fixed

- Line 321: What do you mean by "double-btagged"?
==> rephased

- Line 325: with an addition >> with an additional
==> fixed

- Line 344: You need a space after MC "Data-MC(real tau)"
==> fixed

- Line 339: search regions are signal regions? Why not refer to them as Signal regions?
==> fixed

- Lin3 366: Should it be "it" in "considering it's from the decay chain"?
==> rephased

- Line 372: Rephrase this "So a Higgs resonance" ...avoid startng a sentence with "So"
==>rephased

- Line 383: Rephrase this "the flying direction is unknown."
==> rephased

- Line 383: you need to motivate why a fit is no longer feasible in these channels
==> due to extra neutrino from $W$ decay.

- Table 4 & 5: remove  "tqH(tautau) search"from the caption
==> fixed

- Line 388: Boosted decision trees > Boosted decision trees (BDT)
==> fixed

- Figure one: Fix "tt^{-}" the first "t" is not in math mode
==> fixed

- Line 485: No need to re-explain h-damp. This was done earlier
==> this is first time mentioned, keep the explanation 

- Line 491-495: You are using internal weights for the scale variations right? this description is incorrect. please up-date this
==> fixed 

- Line 499: space missing in "n scale(muF),jet-to" and in "uncertainty,resummation scale uncertainty,"
==> fixed

- Line 504: why do you say "within approximately". Isn't it 30%? or does it vary and up to 30%?
==> it's approximately 30%.

- Line 523:"nterfaced either" should be rephrased to say the nominal is compared to an alternative sample interfaced with XX
==> fixed

- Line 560: channel >> channels
==> fixed 
- Line 570: missing space "2.6 sigma"
==> fixed

- Figure 2: comparision >> comparison
==> fixed

- Line 591: cofficients >> coefficients  
==> fixed
