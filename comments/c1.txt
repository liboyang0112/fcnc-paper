Dear authors,

thank for the first draft of the paper. I find it well structured and complete enough for a first draft.

I will comment first on general aspects of the paper draft and I have detailed comments on the abstract and Introduction section. Detailed comments of the rest of sections will follow later in a separated mail.


* General: could you please start using the standard ATLAS paper cover, acknowledgments section, etc, in general all the standard parts of the ATLAS papers?
====> will add
* Section 2: ATLAS requires now a sentence on the ATLAS software, such as:
An extensive software suite [xx] is used in the reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.
where the [xx] reference is ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001
====> done

* Section 5.1: I think that the paper needs a summary table of the MC programs used. The information is there in the text, but it is much easier to digest if you add a table where, for each signal and background process you state at least: ME generator, Parton Showering program and PDF set.
====> done

* Section 6.2 and Tables 3-4: "separation" and "importance" should be defined in the text. Also check the typesetting of the latex, several characters are in italic, while they should be roman.
====> done
* Figures: the labels (a1), (a2), etc should appear below the figure and not inside it.
====>done
* Figure 1: You should show the prefit syst. uncertainties in the figure.
====> done.
* Figure 2: I would move this figure to aux material and add prefit syst. uncertainties. If I understand correctly, it is the same as figures 3 and 4, just prefit and with different binning.
====> Yes,you are right. removed.

* Section 7: I find the systematic session a bit shallow, because it mainly focuses on the description of the systematics, but it is not very detailed on the uncertainties values. I recommend to add a table with the magnitude of the uncertainties (including statistical uncertainties) or, even better, with the impact of the systematics on the limit (in this section or in section 8).
====> done.

* Section 9: The postfit yields table should be moved to the main body, here.
===> add yields as a Auxiliary Material.

* Section 10: the Conclusion section cannot be a copy&paste of the abstract. It is OK if you want to keep the first couple of sentence, but please change the rest.
In addition you should: mention the improvement wrt to the previous ATLAS result of 36 ifb; if it improves the previous state of the art; mention the EFT constraints set in the previous section.
===> done.

* Appendix: for papers, appendix should be avoided, this section should be called "Auxiliary Material" and remove the text outside of the captions.
===> done.

* Tables 6-8: change 0+-0 with "-" and please use the PDG rounding.
====> done

More detailed comments:
* l8: a Higgs boson
====> done
* l8: decays "into"
====> done
* l26: ... there are still chances to find new physics improving the sensitivity of previous searches.
====> done
* l29: would -> could
====> done

* l41: remove the sentence "but they ... difference"
* l42: studies, "despite a likely suppression due to the t-H mass difference"
===> ?


* l44: ... in the SM is expected to have a small cross section at LHC centre of mass energy.
====> done
* l45: Move the sentence "So..." to l44 after "be enhanced."
====> done

* l51: Around here you should mention that SM values for the ttbar cross section and for the top-quark branching ratios are assumed.
====> ???

* l57: change to tau+tau-
====> done
* l59: if -> assuming
====> done
* l62: performed a similar search
====> done
* l66: on the decay mode of the Higgs boson into \tau-leptons with the complete Run 2 dataset collected in 2015-2018.
====> done
* l71: \tau_{lep}, lep should be in roman.
====> done

* l590: interactions
====> done
* l591: to -> into
====> done
* l594: the Higgs -> a Higgs
====> done
