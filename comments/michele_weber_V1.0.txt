Dear Michele, 

    Thank you so much for your comments and see the replies "==>" below.
     cheers 
     -weiming for the team 

﻿I had a look at abstract and intro of V1.0 from 18.2.2022.
I will continue reading but decided to post what I have so far, see below. Thank you !
==>Thanks 

10: and corresponds -> that corresponds
==> fixed

11: I suggest: two production processes -> two processes
==> fixed

12: with the Higgs -> with a Higgs
==> fixed 

13: one of top quarks -> one top quark OR of of the top quarks
==> it seems clear as is 

15: space between lepton and (e,mu)
==> fixed 

16: I suggest to split the sentence: ...multiple jets. Event kinematics…
==> fixed 

47–51: I tried to reformulate a little, see if you like it:
        After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2]     
      collaborations, a comprehensive programme of measurements has been conducted to explore this new particle.   
      Measurements so far proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, the program is
     ongoing and precision measurements as well as searches for rare new physics processes beyond the Standar Model  
   (BSM) are underway. One such possibility are flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions between …. WHICH 
     HAVE been actively...

==> Thanks, rephased.

82:  that THE BRANCHING FRACTION B(t → uH)  is null.
==> fixed 

84 (remove "the") upper limits at 95% CL on the branching fractions are set at B(t → cH) < 0.11% assuming  B(t→uH)=0, and B(t → uH) < 0.12% assuming B(t→cH)=0.
==> fixed 

94: this analysis -> the analysis reported here"
==> fixed 

96-99 The dataset is divided into several final states depending on the production mode and the W boson decay.
Is the rest of lines 97 to 103 really needed here in the introduction ? While also being difficult to read I am not sure how much it add to list all the final states here and explain what they are called. I have started to reformulate [Pair production events where the W boson decays hadronically (leptonicall) are referred to as th (tl). The contribution of W → τν is included as τlep in tl when the τ decays into a light lepton (electron or muon) or as τhad in th when the τ decays hadronically.]… But I think that if can be dropped altogether.  And start again with “More signal regions were exploited here…"
==> rephased and it would be good to give people some idea about the final states early on. 

104 Run2 data. In addition, an improved treatment of misidentified tau leptons in simulation and data-driven…are implemented.
