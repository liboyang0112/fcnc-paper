Dear authors,

I still had some outstanding comments on draft 0.1. The line numbers, figure and tables refer to version 0.1.

* Title is very long, remove "(q=u,c)"
==> fixed 

* l136: "l" is not defined. It should be light lepton l=e or \mu.
==> fixed

* l137: e\mu 4\nu.
==> fixed 

* l167: missing space before \tauhad
==> fixed 

* Table 1: Also for the hadronic channel, you should write the final state: th tauhadtauhad.
==> fixed 

* l284: Is VH described in this section?
==> added the VH description

* l298: I think that section 5.2 would be better placed after section 6.2
==> The fakes are part of background modeling. It would be good to discuss first before comparing to data in section 6.2. 

* l298: "fake" is jargon. Here and thereafter use misidentified, then define fake, if you want to use it.
==> fixed

* l301: than "for" electron...
==> fixed

* l302: real -> prompt
==> fixed

* l303: monte carlo -> Monte Carlo simulation
==> fixed

* l304-305: The contribution from these events is estimated with a data-driven method called ABCD.
==> fixed 
* l305: remove "by cutting on ...". Leave the explanation of the method for later.
==> fixed 
* l308: use "multijet" or "multi-jet" consistently in all the text
==> "multi-jet" is used in the paper
* l308: Studies based on simulation.
==> fixed 
* l313-340: This part is really poorly written, please review and improve it. I attached a pdf with my corrections, because they are many.
==> Thanks, that's helpful. The section is improved, but it may need other iteration.

* l346: ... Higgs boson, where the remaining top quark decays into Wb.
==> fixed 
* l348: or muon, together with a significant...
==> fixed 
* l348: smaller -> lowest pT
==>fixed

* l350: "in some signal events..." is a confused sentence, can you reformulate?
==> rephased

* l355: targets "either"
==> fixed 
* l366: b-jet -> b-jet. It should be changed here and in several other places. Use italic for particles.
==>fixed
* l366: "So a Higgs resonance..." it should be rewritten with a more formal style.
==> rephased

* l368: di-tau -> the two -leptons
==> fixed 

* l371: taken -> assumed
==> fixed

* l376: "..., the neutrino has a large momentum..."
==> fixed 

* l379: After the event reconstruction, a number of variables are used to discriminate the signal from the background using a multivariate analysis described in Section 6.2"
==> fixed 
* l382: "Boosted decision trees (BDT)" and add a reference for BDT
==> fixed 
* l383: All -> "all signal events from..."
==> fixed 
* l383: remove "are used" and "against".
==> fixed 
* l383: "All background sources from SM processes (...) are also used in the training."
==> fixed 
* l388: "in Tables 3 and 4.Te discriminating variables used are:
==> fixed 
* l389-428: Check the latex, superscripts and subscripts should be in roman, unless they are particle symbols. T for transverse is a subscript, not a superscript.
==> fixed  
* l389 and l411 and tables 3 and 4: E_T^miss (!)
==> fixed 
* l392: leading light lepton
==> fixed 
* l393: \Chi2 derived from the kinematic fit of the neutrino momentum.
==> fixed 
* Table 3 and 4: check the latex, subscripts and superscripts.
==> fixed 
* Table 3 caption: for the leptonic channel. The values represent the separation and importance of each variable.
==> fixed
* Table 4 caption: for the hadronic channel. The values represent the separation and importance of each variable.
==> fixed 
* l399: explain how mW is reconstructed.
==> fixed 
* l405,417,418,419: b-jet -> b-jet
==> fixed 
* l406: Min(m_\tau\tau q-jet)
==> fixed 
* l409: Min(m_jj)
==> fixed 
* l410: "... of the W candidate."
==> fixed 
* Eq2: add more space between x and y definition
==> fixed 
* l417,418,419: bjet -> b-jet
==> fixed 
* l421: Max(\eta_\tau)
==> fixed 
* l424: qjet-> q-jet
==> fixed
* l428: Ptmiss -> E_T^miss
==> fixed 
* l429: \tau_had \pt distribution
==> fixed 
* l430: Figure 1
==> fixed 
* l435: each SR
==> fixed 
* l436: show -> shows
==> fixed 
* Ref 104 is an internal note, use a public reference.
==> fixed
