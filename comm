I had a look at abstract and intro of V1.0 from 18.2.2022.
I will continue reading but decided to post what I have so far, see below. Thank you !
10: and corresponds -> that corresponds
11: I suggest: two production processes -> two processes
12: with the Higgs -> with a Higgs
13: one of top quarks -> one top quark OR of of the top quarks
15: space between lepton and (e,mu)
16: I suggest to split the sentence: ...multiple jets. Event kinematics…
47–51: I tried to reformulate a little, see if you like it:
        After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS [1] and CMS [2]     
      collaborations, a comprehensive programme of measurements has been conducted to explore this new particle.   
      Measurements so far proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, the program is
     ongoing and precision measurements as well as searches for rare new physics processes beyond the Standar Model  
   (BSM) are underway. One such possibility are flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions between …. WHICH 
     HAVE been actively...
57  B(t → qH) = 10E-15.
64: an observation OF AN ENHANCED RATE of… ?
65: I suggest replacing “On the other hand", with “Furthermore, …"
65: the associated  single-top and Higgs production process through this interaction would enhance the...
67   The study of this process will therefore also contribute
68 remove ’small’
68 LHC centre of mass energy -> 13 TeV centre of mass energy.
72/73 I suggest not starting a new paragraph
74 add “branching fraction before B(t->qH)
74 yielding -> denoted as ?
78: ...level (CL) for branching fractions of…
82:  that THE BRANCHING FRACTION B(t → uH)  is null.
84 (remove "the") upper limits at 95% CL on the branching fractions are set at B(t → cH) < 0.11% assuming  B(t→uH)=0, and B(t → uH) < 0.12% assuming B(t→cH)=0.
94: this analysis -> the analysis reported here"
96-99 The dataset is divided into several final states depending on the production mode and the W boson decay.
Is the rest of lines 97 to 103 really needed here in the introduction ? While also being difficult to read I am not sure how much it add to list all the final states here and explain what they are called. I have started to reformulate [Pair production events where the W boson decays hadronically (leptonicall) are referred to as th (tl). The contribution of W → τν is included as τlep in tl when the τ decays into a light lepton (electron or muon) or as τhad in th when the τ decays hadronically.]… But I think that if can be dropped altogether.  And start again with “More signal regions were exploited here…"
104 Run2 data. In addition, an improved treatment of misidentified tau leptons in simulation and data-driven…are implemented.
106 a multivariate technique based on boosted...
