A search for flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) $tqH$ interactions involving a top quark, an up-type quark ($q=u, c$), and a

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and 
CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa} collaborations, 
%Since the observation of Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} at
a comprehensive programme of measurements % of its properties
has been conducted to explore this new particle. Measurements so far proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. 
However, the program is ongoing and precision measurements as well as searches for rare new physics processes beyond the Standar Model (BSM)
are underway. One such possibility is flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions between the Higgs boson, 
the top quark, and an up-quark, $tqH$ ($q=u, c$), which has been actively searched for by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.  
%with increased precision and proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. 
%for nearly a decade, by which no significant sign of deviation from Standard Model (SM) was observed until today.
%However the LHC still provides an excellent opportunity to search for rare new physics processes beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  
%there are still chances to find new physics by improving the sensitivity of previous searches.
%The flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions 
%between the Higgs boson, the top quark, and a $u$- or $c$-quark, $tqH$ ($q=u,c$) has been actively searched for by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. %is still an active topic.
Since the Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark~\cite{Aad:2015zhl},
%with a measured mass $m_H=125.09 \pm 0.24~\gev$~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}, 
such interactions could manifest themselves as FCNC top-quark decays~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Agashe:2013hma}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(}\DIFaddend $t\to qH$\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{)~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Agashe:2013hma}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .  
In the Standard Model (SM), the FCNC interaction is forbidden at tree level and suppressed at higher orders due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}. The $t\to qH$ branching fraction in the SM is calculated to be exceedingly small, $\BR(t\to qH)\approx10^{-15}$~\cite{Eilam:1990zc,Mele:1998ag,AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,Zhang:2013xya}. 
%such decays are suppressed relative to the dominant $t\to Wb$ decay mode, since $tqH$ 
%interactions are forbidden at the tree level and suppressed even at higher orders in the perturbative expansion due to the 
%Glashow--Iliopoulos--Maiani (GIM) mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}.
%As a result, the SM predictions for the $t \to Hq$ branching 
%ratios ($\BR$) are exceedingly small, $\BR(t\to Hu) \sim 10^{-17} $ and $\BR(t\to Hc) \sim 10^{-15}$~\cite{Eilam:1990zc,Mele:1998ag,AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,Zhang:2013xya}, making them undetectable in the foreseeable future.
In contrast, large enhancements of these branching ratios are possible in some scenarios beyond the SM.
Examples include quark-singlet models~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2002kr}, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)~\cite{Branco:2hdm2012} with or without flavour violation,
%of type I, with explicit flavour conservation,
%and of type II, such as
the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM)~\cite{Bejar:2000ub, Guasch:1999jp,Cao:2007dk,Cao:2014udj},
supersymmetric models with R-parity violation~\cite{Eilam:2001dh}, composite Higgs models with partial compositeness~\cite{Azatov:2014lha}, 
or warped extra dimensions models with SM fermions in the bulk~\cite{Azatov:2009na}. 
In these scenarios, branching ratios can be as high as $\BR(t\to qH) \sim 10^{-5}$. 
An even larger branching ratio of  $\BR(t\to cH) \sim 10^{-3}$ can be reached in 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation (type III),
since a tree-level FCNC coupling is no longer forbidden by any symmetry~\cite{Cheng:1987rs,Baum:2008qm,Chen:2013qta,Chiang:2015cba,Crivellin:2015hha,Botella:2015hoa, Gori:2017tvg,Chiang:2017fjr}. 
%While other FCNC top couplings ($tq\gamma$, $tqZ$, $tqg$) are also enhanced in these scenarios beyond the SM, 
%the largest enhancements are typically found for the $tqH$ couplings, and in particular the $tcH$ coupling~\cite{Agashe:2013hma}.
Therefore, an observation of an enhanced rate of this decay would be a clear evidence for new physics.
%The $tqH$ interaction could also potentially open up more
%Higgs decay channels, such as $H\rightarrow t^*q\rightarrow Wbq$, but they are likely suppressed due to the $t-H$ mass difference,
%which could be interesting for future studies.
Furthermore, if the $tqH$ interaction exists, the associated single-top and  Higgs  production process through this interaction would enhance 
%becomes non-zero, enhancing 
the total
production cross section of $pp\rightarrow tH$.
The study of this process will therefore also contribute to the FCNC interaction searches~\cite{Greljo:2014dka}.
The $tH$ associated production in the SM is expected to have a cross section of $92^{+7}_{-12}$ fb at LHC 13 TeV centre of mass energy~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

Searches for $t \to qH$ decays have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, taking advantage of the large samples
of top-quark pair ($\ttbar$) events collected in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7~\tev$ and $8~\tev$~\cite{Aad:2014dya,Aad:2015pja,Khachatryan:2016atv} during Run~1 of the LHC, as well as at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$~\cite{fcnc36} using early Run~2 data.
In these searches, one of the top quarks is required to decay into $Wb$, while the other top quark decays into $qH$ with a small branching ratio 
 $\BR(t\to qH)$, denoted as $\ttbar \to WbHq$.\footnote{In the following, $WbHq$ is used to denote both $W^+b H\bar{q}$ and its charge conjugate, $HqW^- \bar{b}$. Similarly, 
$WbWb$ is used to denote $W^+b W^- \bar{b}$.}  The Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of $m_H=125~\gev$ and to decay as predicted by
the SM.
%The assumption of using SM-like Higgs boson branching ratios is motivated by the fact that measurements of the flavour-diagonal Higgs boson couplings by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are in agreement with the SM prediction within about 10\%~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Sirunyan:2018koj}. 
%Furthermore, typical beyond-the-SM scenarios that predict significant enhancements to $\BR(t\to Hq)$, also predict modifications to the Higgs boson branching ratios at the few percent level or below, well beyond the current experimental precision.
%Some of the most sensitive single-channel searches have been performed in the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, which
%has a small branching ratio of $\BR(H\to \gamma\gamma)\simeq 0.2\%$, but benefits from having a very small background contamination 
%and excellent diphoton mass re\-so\-lu\-tion. 
%Searches targeting signatures with two same-charge leptons or three leptons (electrons or muons), generically referred to as multileptons,
%are able to exploit a branching ratio that is significantly larger for the $H \rightarrow WW^*, \tau\tau$ decay modes than for the $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay mode,
%are able to exploit a significantly larger branching ratio for the Higgs boson decay into $H \to WW^*, \tau\tau$ compared to the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, 
%and are also characterised by relatively small backgrounds.
%However, in general they do not have good mass resolution,\footnote{An exception is the $H\to ZZ^*\to \ell^+\ell^- \ell^{\prime +}\ell^{\prime -}$ 
%($\ell, \ell^\prime = e, \mu$) decay mode, which has a very small branching ratio and thus is not promising for this search.} 
%so any excess would be hard to interpret as originating from $t \to Hq$ decays.
%Finally, searches have also been performed exploiting the dominant Higgs boson decay mode, $H\to b\bar{b}$, which has a branching ratio 
%of $\BR(H\to b\bar{b})\simeq 58\%$.
Compared to Run~1, the Run~2 searches, summarised in Table~\ref{tab:limits_summary_ref}, benefit from the increased $\ttbar$ cross section at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, as well as the larger integrated luminosity.
Using 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, the ATLAS Collaboration has derived upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) of branching ratio
$\BR(t\to cH)<0.22\%$ using $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decays~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd}, $\BR(t\to cH)<0.16\%$ based on
%signatures with two same-charge light leptons (electrons or muons) or three light leptons 
multilepton (electron or muon) signatures resulting from 
$H \to  WW^*, ZZ^*$, $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ in which both $\tau$-leptons decay leptonically~\cite{Aaboud:2018pob},
$\BR(t\to cH)<0.42\%$ using $H\to b\bar{b}$ decay~\cite{fcnc36}, and of $\BR(t\to cH)<0.19\%$ using $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ decay in which at least
one of $\tau$-leptons decays hadronically~\cite{fcnc36}.  
These upper limits are derived assuming that the branching ratio $\BR(t\to uH)$ is null. Similar upper limits are obtained for $\BR(t\to uH)$ assuming $\BR(t\to cH)=0$.
%The searches with  $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$ decays are later published~\cite{fcnc36}, unfortunately with no FCNC signal found.
Combining all of the ATLAS searches using 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ Run~2 data, upper limits at 95\% CL on the branching fractions are 
set at $\BR(t\to cH)<0.11\%$ assuming $\BR(t\to uH)=0$, and $\BR(t\to uH)<0.12\%$ assuming $\BR(t\to cH)=0$~\cite{fcnc36}.

The CMS Collaboration performed a similar search using  
$H\to b\bar{b}$ decays~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} with 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, resulting 
in upper limits of $\BR(t\to cH)<0.47\%$ and $\BR(t\to uH)<0.47\%$, in each case neglecting the other decay mode.
Compared with previous searches, the search in Ref.~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} considers in addition the contribution to the signal from 
$pp \to tH$ production~\cite{Greljo:2014dka}. 
%CMS recently updated their search for $tqH$ in the $H\to b\bar{b}$ channel using
%their full Run 2 data and  set observed(expected) upper limits on $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hu)$ of $7.9\times10^{-4}(1.1\times10^{-3})$ and $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hc)$ of $9.4\times10^{-4}(8.6\times10^{-4})$~\cite{CMS:2021gfa}.
%CMS also recently reported a search for $tqH$ in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ mode using the full Run-2 data and set observed(expected) upper limits on $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hu)$ of $1.9\times10^{-4}(3.1\times10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hc)$ of $7.3\times10^{-4}(5.1\times10^{-4})$~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-20-007}.

%Upper limits on the branching ratios $\BR(t\to Hq)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated to upper limits on the non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings $\lamHq$

%Using the expression derived in Sect. 1.2 of Ref.~\cite{ATL-COM-PHYS-2016-1664}, the coupling $|\lamHq|$ can be extracted as $| \lamHq | = (1.92 \pm 0.02) \sqrt{\BR(t\to Hq)}$.

% ATLAS detector
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{ATLAS detector}
\label{sec:detector}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ATLAS detector~\cite{PERF-2007-01} at the LHC covers almost the entire solid angle around the collision point,\footnote{ATLAS 
uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the 
centre of the detector.  
%and the $z$-axis coinciding with the axis of the beam pipe.
The $x$-axis points from
the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, %and
the $y$-axis points upward,
and the $z$-axis coincides with the axis of the beam pipe.
Cylindrical coordinates ($r$,$\phi$) are used 
in the transverse plane, $\phi$ being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in 
terms of the polar angle $\theta$ as $\eta = - \ln \tan(\theta/2)$.
Angular distance is measured in units of $\Delta R\equiv \sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^2+(\Delta\phi)^2}$.} and consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid producing a
2~T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer incorporating three large toroid magnet assemblies with eight coils each. The inner detector contains a high-granularity silicon pixel detector, including the %newly-installed
insertable B-layer~\cite{IBL1,IBL2,Abbott:2018ikt}, installed in 2014, and a silicon microstrip tracker, together providing a precise reconstruction of tracks of charged particles in the pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<2.5$.
The inner detector also includes a transition radiation tracker that provides tracking and electron identification for $|\eta|<2.0$.
%The electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeter uses lead as the absorber material 
%and liquid-argon (LAr) as the active medium, and is divided into barrel ($|\eta|<1.475$) and end-cap ($1.375<|\eta|<3.2$) regions.  
%Hadron calorimetry is also based on the sampling technique, with either scintillator tiles or LAr as the active medium, and with 
%steel, copper, or tungsten as the absorber material. The calorimeters cover $|\eta|<4.9$. 
%Hadronic calorimetry is provided by the steel/scintillating-tile calorimeter,
%segmented into three barrel structures within $|\eta| < 1.7$, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters.
%The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules
%optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements respectively.
The calorimeter system covers the pseudorapidity range $|\eta| < 4.9$. Within the region $|\eta|< 3.2$, electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by barrel and endcap high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) sampling calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering $|\eta| < 1.8$, to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. Hadronic calorimetry is provided by %the
a steel/scintillator-tile calorimeter, segmented into three barrel structures within $|\eta| < 1.7$, and two copper/LAr hadronic endcap calorimeters.
The solid angle coverage is completed with forward copper/LAr and tungsten/LAr calorimeter modules optimised for electromagnetic and hadronic measurements, respectively.
The calorimeters are surrounded by a muon spectrometer within a magnetic field provided by air-core toroid magnets with a bending integral of about \SI{2.5}{\tesla\metre} in the barrel and up to \SI{6.0}{\tesla\metre} in the endcaps. 
The muon spectrometer measures the trajectories of muons with $|\eta|<2.7$ using multiple layers of high-precision tracking chambers, and is instrumented with separate trigger chambers covering $|\eta|<2.4$. A two-level trigger system~\cite{Aaboud:2016leb}, consisting of a hardware-based level-1 trigger followed by a software-based high-level trigger, is used to reduce the event rate to a maximum of around \SI{1}{\kHz} for offline storage.
An extensive software suite~\cite{ATL-SOFT-PUB-2021-001} is used in the reconstruction and analysis of real and simulated data, in detector operations, and in the trigger and data acquisition systems of the experiment.

\section{Event reconstruction}
\label{sec:objects}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events are selected from $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector during 2015-2018.
Only events for which all relevant subsystems were operational are considered.
Events are required to have at least one vertex with two or more tracks with transverse momentum
%The event reconstruction is affected by multiple $pp$ collisions in a single bunch crossing and by collisions
%in neighbouring bunch crossings, referred to as pile-up. 
%Interaction vertices from the $pp$ collisions are reconstructed from at least two tracks with transverse momentum
($\pt$) larger than $400~\mev$ that are consistent with originating from the 
beam collision region in the $x$--$y$ plane. If more than one primary vertex candidate is found, the
candidate whose associated tracks form the largest sum of squared $\pt$~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-026}
is selected as the hard-scatter primary vertex.

Electron candidates~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-024,Aaboud:2018ugz} are reconstructed from energy 
clusters in the EM calorimeter that are matched to reconstructed tracks in the inner detector;
electron candidates in the transition region between the EM barrel and endcap calorimeters 
($1.37 < |\eta_{\textrm{cluster}}| < 1.52$) are excluded.
Electron candidates are required to have $|\eta_{\textrm{cluster}}| < 2.47$, and to satisfy tight likelihood-based identification 
criteria~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-024} based on calorimeter, tracking and combined variables that provide 
separation between electrons and jets. 

Muon candidates~\cite{Aad:2016jkr} are reconstructed by matching track segments in %the various
different layers of the muon spectrometer to tracks found in the inner detector;
the resulting muon candidates are re-fitted using the complete track information from both detector systems.
Muon candidates are required to satisfy medium identification criteria~\cite{Aad:2016jkr}. 

Electron (muon) candidates are matched to the primary vertex by requiring that the significance of their transverse impact parameter, $d_0$, 
satisfies $|d_0/\sigma(d_0)|<5\,(3)$, where $\sigma(d_0)$ is the measured uncertainty in $d_0$,
and by requiring that their longitudinal impact parameter, $z_0$, satisfies $|z_0 \sin\theta|<0.5$~mm.
%To reduce the impact of the trigger efficiency uncertainty around the threshold, the leptons are required to have \pt 1~GeV above the threshold.
To further reduce the background from non-prompt leptons, photon conversions and hadrons, lepton candidates are also required to be isolated 
in the tracker and in the calorimeter.
A track-based lepton isolation criterion is defined by calculating the quantity $I_R = \sum \pt^{\textrm{trk}}$ and $E_R = \sum E^{\textrm{clst}}$, where
the scalar sum includes all tracks and energy deposits (excluding the lepton candidate itself) within the cone defined by $\Delta R<0.2 (0.3)$ around the %axis
direction of the electron (muon). The electron (muon) candidates \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{($\ell=e$ or $\mu$) }\DIFaddend are required to satisfy both
%DIF > $I_R/\pt^l < 0.2~(0.3)$ and $E_R/\pt^l < 0.2~(0.3)$.
$I_R/\pt^\ell < 0.2~(0.3)$ and $E_R/\pt^\ell < 0.2~(0.3)$.

Tight isolation working points are also applied in some channels to reduce fake and non-prompt lepton contributions based on a trained isolation boosted decision tree \texttt{PromptLeptonVeto}(PLIV), which is to identify non-prompt light leptons using lifetime information associated with a track jet that matches the selected light lepton~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2019-045}. These additional reconstructed charged particle tracks inside the jet can be
used to increase the precision for identifying the displaced decay vertex of heavy flavor (b, c) hadrons that produced non-prompt leptons.
The tight working points are used for high $\pt$ lepton.
The scale factors for the efficiencies of the tight \texttt{PLIV} working points are measured using the tag and probe method
with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$Z\rightarrow l^+l^-$ ($l=e$ or $\mu$) }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$Z\rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-$ }\DIFaddend events. These scale factors have also been checked for the electron or muon from the tau decay
using $Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\rightarrow e\mu4\nu$ samples, which is consistent at 2\% level. To be conservative, an
additional uncertainty of $\pm 2\%$ is considered for the PLIV efficiency for the tau-lepton in the lepton+$\thad$ channels.
%Additionally, the $\Htautau$ search requires leptons to
%satisfy a calorimeter-based isolation criterion; a requirement is made on the sum of the transverse energy of
%topological clusters within the cone defined by $\Delta R<0.2$ around the lepton, after subtracting the contribution
%from the energy deposit of the lepton itself and correcting for pile-up effects, to be less than a $\pt$-dependent 
%percentage of the lepton energy. 
%The combined efficiency of track-based and calorimeter-based isolation requirements made by the $\Htautau$ 
%search is 90\% (99\%) at $\pt=25\;(60)~\gev$.

%a Gradient isolation working points are used for both electrons and muons. The working points are based on cut maps derived from the $Z\to l^+l^-$ Monte Carlo samples. The efficiency maps are simply derived from the sum of transverse energy of the clusters deposited in the calorimeter in the given cone. The efficiency for the leptons with a certain $\pt$ is $(0.1143*\pt[\GeV]+92.14)\%*(0.1143*\pt[\GeV]+92.14)\%$.

%Jet reconstruction in the calorimeter starts from topological clustering~\cite{Aad:2016upy} of individual calorimeter cells calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale. 
The reconstructed jets are then calibrated to the particle level by the application of a jet energy scale 
derived from simulation and in situ corrections based on $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ data~\cite{Aaboud:2017jcu}. %(TBD: check PFlow jets description)
The calibrated jets used are required to have $\pt > 25~\gev$ and $|\eta| < 2.5$.
Jet four-momenta are corrected for pile-up effects using the jet-area method~\cite{Cacciari:2008gn}.

Quality criteria are imposed to reject events that contain any jets arising from non-collision sources
or detector noise~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2015-029}.  To reduce the contamination due to jets originating from pile-up interactions,
additional requirements are imposed on the jet vertex tagger (JVT)~\cite{Aad:2015ina} output for jets with $\pt<60~\gev$ and $|\eta| < 2.4$.

Jets containing $b$-hadrons are identified ($b$-tagged) via the DL1r tagger~\cite{Aad:2019epj79,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-013} %newref
%\cite{Aad:2015ydr,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-012} 
that uses multivariate techniques to combine information about the impact parameters of displaced tracks and the  topological properties 
of secondary and tertiary decay vertices reconstructed within the jet. For each jet, a value for the multivariate $b$-tagging discriminant is 
calculated. A jet is considered $b$-tagged if this value is above the threshold corresponding to
an average 70\% efficiency to tag a $b$-quark jet, with a light-jet\footnote{Light-jet refers to a jet originating from the hadronisation of a light quark ($u$, $d$, $s$) or a gluon.} rejection factor of about 385 and a charm-jet rejection factor of about 12, as determined for jets with
$\pt >20~\gev$ and $|\eta|<2.5$ in simulated $\ttbar$ events~\cite{Aad:2019epj79}.

Hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton ($\had$) candidates are reconstructed from energy clusters in the calorimeters and
associated inner-detector tracks~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-033}. %newref
%~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2015-045}.

The medium working point has a combined reconstruction and identification efficiency of 75\% (60\%) for one-prong (three-prong) $\had$ 
decays, and an expected rejection factor against light-jets of 35 (240)~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2019-033}. 
Electrons that are reconstructed as one-prong $\had$ candidates are removed via a BDT trained to reject electrons.
Events with a $b$-tagged $\had$ candidate are rejected.

%Overlaps between candidate objects are removed sequentially, following this order: muons, electrons,
%$\tauhad$ (only for the $\Htautau$ search), and jets. In the $\Hbb$ search, firstly, electron candidates that lie 
%within $\Delta R = 0.01$ of a muon candidate are removed to suppress contributions from muon bremsstrahlung. 
%Overlaps between electron and jet candidates are resolved next, and finally, overlaps between remaining jet candidates 
%and muon candidates are removed. Clusters from identified electrons are not excluded during jet reconstruction. 
%In order to avoid double-counting of electrons as jets, the closest jet whose axis is within ${\Delta}R = 0.2$ of an electron

%The overlap removal procedure between the remaining jet candidates and muon candidates is designed to remove those muons

%Jets and muons may also appear in close proximity when the jet results from high-$\pt$ muon bremsstrahlung,

%if the jet has at least three tracks originating from the primary vertex; otherwise the jet is removed and the muon is kept.
%In the $\Htautau$ search, a fixed cone size of $\Delta R=0.2$ is used to determine the overlap between
%candidate objects, and only the highest-$\pt$ (leading) or the two leading $\tauhad$ candidates (depending on the

To avoid double counting reconstructed objects, an overlap removal procedure is applied.

%In the $\Htautau$ search, the objects are removed with the following sequence: if two electrons have overlapping second-layer cluster, or shared tracks, the electron with lower $\pt$ is removed; $\tauhad$ within a $\Delta R=0.2$ cone of an electron or muon are removed; if a muon sharing an ID track with an electron and the muon is calo-tagged, the muon is removed, otherwise the electron is removed; jets within a $\Delta R=0.2$ cone of an electron are removed; electrons within a $\Delta R=0.4$ cone of a jet are removed; when a muon ID track is ghost associated to a jet or within a $\Delta R=0.2$ cone of a jet, the jet is removed if it has less than 3 tracks with $\pt>500$ MeV or has a relative small $\pt$ ($\pt^{\mu}>0.5\pt^{\text{jet}} \text{ and } \pt^{\mu}>0.7[\text{the scalar sum of the } \pt \text{'s of the jet tracks with } \pt>500$ MeV]); muons within a $\Delta R=0.4$ cone of a jet are removed; jets within a $\Delta R=0.2$ cone of the leading $\tauhad$ ($\lephad$), or with the two leading $\tauhad$'s ($\hadhad$), are removed.

%firstly, the electron within a ${\Delta}R = 0.2$ cone of muons are excluded, then the $\tau_{had}$'s or jets within a ${\Delta}R = 0.2$ cone of an electron or muon are excluded. Finally, the jets within a ${\Delta}R = 0.2$ cone of the leading $\had$ ($\lephad$), or with the two leading $\had$’s ($\hadhad$) are excluded.

The missing transverse momentum $\mpt$ (with magnitude $\met$) is defined as the negative vector sum of the 
$\pt$ of all selected and calibrated objects in the event, including a term to account for momentum from soft particles 
in the event which are not associated with any of the selected objects. 
This soft term is calculated from inner-detector tracks matched to the selected primary vertex to make it more resilient to
contamination from pile-up interactions~\cite{Aaboud:2018tkc}.




% Data sample and event preselection
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Data sample and event preselection}
\label{sec:data_presel}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ with 25 ns bunch spacing collected from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139~\ifb$.
Only events recorded with a single-electron trigger, a single-muon trigger, or a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{di-$\tau$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{di-tau }\DIFaddend trigger under stable beam conditions 
and for which all detector subsystems were operational are considered for analysis. While the events recorded by di-lepton triggers fall into the control regions used for \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{fake-tau }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{fake tau }\DIFaddend background estimation.
The number of $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing in this dataset ranges from about 8 to 45, with an average of 24.

Single-electron and single-muon triggers with low $\pt$ thresholds and lepton isolation requirements are combined in a logical OR 
with higher-threshold triggers but with a looser identification criterion and without any isolation requirement.
The lowest $\pt$ threshold used for muons is 20 (26)~\gev\ in 2015 (2016-2018), while for electrons the threshold is 24 (26)~\gev.
%For ditau triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\tauhad$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev\ with the medium identification required.
For \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{di-$\tau$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{di-tau }\DIFaddend triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (subleading) \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\had$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tau }\DIFaddend candidate is 35 (25)~\gev.
Events satisfying the trigger selection are required to have at least one primary vertex candidate.
To reduce the impact of the trigger efficiency uncertainty around the threshold, the leptons are required to have \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a }\DIFaddend \pt \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of }\DIFaddend 1~GeV above the threshold. 

The signal final state including \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{an }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a light lepton (}\DIFaddend electron or muon\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{) }\DIFaddend or $\lep$ are referred to as leptonic channel, otherwise hadronic channel.
The events in the leptonic channel are recorded by single-electron or single-muon trigger, required to have exactly one electron or muon that matches, with $\Delta R < 0.15$, the lepton reconstructed by the trigger. Further requirements are defined targeting different signal decay modes:  
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_h\lephad$: Targeting $t_hH$ and $t_ht(qH)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{final states }\DIFaddend with $H\to\lephad$ decay. Exactly one $\had$ with opposite-side charge to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\tau_l$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\lep$ }\DIFaddend is required, including at least three jets with exactly one $b$-jet.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t_l\hadhad$: Targeting $t_lH$ and $t_lt(qH)$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t_{\ell}\hadhad$: Targeting $t_{\ell}H$ and $t_{\ell}t(qH)$ final states }\DIFaddend with $H\to\hadhad$ decay. Exactly \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{one }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a light }\DIFaddend lepton and two opposite-sign $\had$ are selected, including at least 1 jet with exactly one $b$-jet.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t_l\had$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t_{\ell}\had$}\DIFaddend : Also targeting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t_lH$ and $t_lt(qH)$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t_{\ell}H$ and $t_{\ell}t(qH)$ final states }\DIFaddend with $H\to\hadhad$ decay when one of the $\had$ fails the tau reconstruction or identification so that there is only
  one $\had$ candidate reconstructed. Exactly one $\had$ with same-sign charge to the \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{light }\DIFaddend lepton is required, including at least 2 jets with exactly one $b$-jet.
\end{itemize}

The events in the hadronic channel are recorded by di-tau trigger, required to have both leading and subleading $\had$ passed the trigger. Further requirements are defined targeting signal decay modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_h\hadhad$: Targeting $t_hH$ and $t_ht(qH)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{final states }\DIFaddend with $H\to\hadhad$ decay. Exactly two $\had$ with opposite-sign charge are selected, including at least 3 jet with exactly one $b$-jet.
\end{itemize}

The above requirements apply to the reconstructed objects defined in Section~\ref{sec:objects}.
%, which are in general different between both searches. 
These requirements are referred to as the preselection and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:preselection}.

An overview of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{MC }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Monte Carlo (MC) }\DIFaddend generators used for the main signal and background samples is summarized in Table~\ref{mob}.
\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend Samples of simulated $\ttbar \to WbHq$ ($tt(qH)$) events were generated with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) generator\footnote{In the following, 
the order of a generator should be understood as referring to the order in the strong coupling constant at which the matrix-element (ME) calculation 
is performed.} {\powheg}~v2 \cite{Frixione:2007nw,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
%{\amcatnlolong}~2.4.3~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}  (referred to in the following as {\amcatnlo})
with the NNPDF3.0 NLO~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} parton distribution function (PDF) set and interfaced to {\pythia} 8.212~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs} with the NNPDF2.3 LO~\cite{Ball:2012cx} PDF set for the modelling of parton showering (PS), hadronisation, and the underlying event. 
The A14~\cite{ATLASUETune4} set of tuned parameters in {\pythia} controlling the description of multiparton interactions and  
initial- and final-state radiation, referred to as the tune, was used.
The signal sample is normalised to the same total cross section as used for the inclusive $t\bar{t}\to WbWb$ sample (see discussion below) and
assuming a benchmark branching ratio of $\BR_{\mathrm{ref}}(t\to qH)=0.1\%$.
The case of both top quarks decaying into $qH$ is neglected in the analysis given the existing upper limits on $\BR(t \to qH)$ (Section~\ref{sec:intro}).

The $tH$ signal events were generated by {\amcatnlolong}~2.6.2~\cite{Alwall:2014hca}  (referred to in the following as {\amcatnlo})
with the NNPDF3.0 NLO parton distribution function (PDF) set and interfaced to {\pythia} 8.212 with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set for the modelling of parton showering,
hadronisation, and the underlying event with the A14 tune.
Depending on either up quark or charm quark involved in the FCNC production, the effective Lagrangian of $tqH$ interaction are parametrised using
dim-6 operators~\cite{fcnc_production_theory}. We obtain $\sigma(ug\to tH)$ = 0.711 pb and $\sigma(cg\to tH)$ = 0.103 pb using $\BR_{\mathrm{ref}}(t\to qH)=0.1\%$ as benchmark.   

The nominal sample used to model the $\ttbar$ background was generated with the NLO generator {\powheg}~v2
%\cite{Frixione:2007nw,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
using the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set. The {\powheg} model parameter $h_{\textrm{damp}}$, which controls 
matrix element to parton shower matching and effectively regulates the high-$\pt$ radiation, was set to 1.5 times the top-quark mass. 
The parton showers, hadronisation, and underlying event were modelled by {\pythia}~8.210 with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set in combination with the A14 tune.
Alternative $\ttbar$ simulation samples used to derive parton shower systematic uncertainties are described in Section~\ref{sec:syst_bkgmodeling}. 
The generated $\ttbar$ samples are normalised to a theoretical cross section of $832^{+46}_{-51}$~pb, 
computed using \textsc{Top++}~v2.0~\cite{Czakon:2011xx} at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO), 
including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon 
terms~\cite{Cacciari:2011hy,Baernreuther:2012ws,Czakon:2012zr,Czakon:2012pz,Czakon:2013goa}.

Samples of single-top-quark events corresponding to the $t$-channel production mechanism were generated with the 
{\powheg}~v2~\cite{Frederix:2012dh} generator, using the 4F scheme  for the NLO matrix-element calculations
and the corresponding NNPDF3.0 NLO set of PDFs.
Samples corresponding to the $tW$- and $s$-channel production mechanisms were generated 
with {\powheg}~v2 using the five-flavour scheme. Overlaps between the $\ttbar$ and $tW$ final states were avoided by using 
the diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2005vw}.
The parton showers, hadronisation and the underlying event were modelled using {\pythia}~8.230~\cite{Sjostrand:2006za} using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set.
%with the CTEQ6L1~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw,Nadolsky:2008zw} PDF set %in combination with the Perugia 2012 tune~\cite{Skands:2010ak}.
The single-top-quark samples are normalised to the approximate NNLO theoretical cross 
sections~\cite{Kidonakis:2011wy,Kidonakis:2010ux,Kidonakis:2010tc}. 

Samples of $W/Z$+jets events were generated with the {\sherpa}~2.2.1~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta} generator. 
The matrix element was calculated for up to two partons at NLO and up to four partons at LO using 
\textsc{Comix}~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv} and \textsc{OpenLoops}~\cite{Cascioli:2011va}. The matrix-element calculation 
is merged with the {\sherpa} parton shower~\cite{Schumann:2007mg} using the ME+PS@NLO prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}. 
The PDF set used for the matrix-element calculation is NNPDF3.0 NNLO~\cite{Ball:2014uwa} with a dedicated parton shower tuning developed for {\sherpa}. 
Separate samples were generated for different $W/Z$+jets categories using filters for a $b$-jet 
($W/Z$+$\geq$1$b$+jets), a $c$-jet and no $b$-jet ($W/Z$+$\geq$1$c$+jets), and with a veto on $b$- and $c$-jets 
($W/Z$+light-jets), which are combined into the inclusive $W/Z$+jets samples.
Both the $W$+jets and $Z$+jets samples are normalised to their respective inclusive NNLO theoretical 
cross sections calculated with \textsc{FEWZ}~\cite{Anastasiou:2003ds}.

Samples of $WW/WZ/ZZ$+jets events were generated with {\sherpa}~2.2.1 using the CT10 PDF set
and include processes containing up to four electroweak vertices. 
In the case of $WW/WZ$+jets ($ZZ$+jets) the matrix element was calculated for zero (up to one) additional partons 
at NLO and up to three partons at LO using the same procedure as for the $W/Z$+jets samples. 
The final states simulated require one of the bosons to decay leptonically and the other hadronically.
All diboson samples are normalised to their NLO theoretical cross sections provided by {\sherpa}. 

Samples of $\ttbar V$ and $\ttbar H$ events were generated with {\amcatnlo}~2.2.1, using NLO matrix elements and the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set,
and interfaced to {\pythia}~8.210 with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set and the A14 tune. 
%Instead, the $\ttbar V$ samples used in the $\Hbb$ search are based on LO matrix elements computed for up to two additional partons 
%using the NNPDF3.0 NLO PDF set, and merged using the CKKW-L approach~\cite{Lonnblad:2001iq}.
The $\ttbar V$ samples are normalised to the NLO cross section computed with {\amcatnlo}, while the $\ttbar H$ sample is normalised using 
the NLO cross section recommended in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

Samples of $WH$ and $ZH$, collectively referred to as $VH$ are generated using {\powheg}~v2 \cite{Frixione:2007nw,Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}
and interfaced to {\pythia}~8.210 with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set and the A14 tune.
The contribution of $tH$ associated production is also considered as part of SM Higgs background.
The sample is generated using {\amcatnlolong}~2.6.2~\cite{Alwall:2014hca} and interfaced with {\pythia}~8.210 with CT10PDF
and A14 tune. The MC predictions are normalised using the NLO cross section recommended in Ref.~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}. 

All generated samples, except those produced with the {\sherpa}~\cite{Gleisberg:2008ta} event generator, 
utilise \textsc{EvtGen}~1.2.0~\cite{Lange:2001uf} to model the decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. 
To model the effects of pile-up, events from minimum-bias interactions were generated using {\pythia}~8.186~\cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}  
in combination with the A2 tune~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2011-014}, 
and overlaid onto the simulated hard-scatter events according to the luminosity profile of the recorded data. 
The generated events were processed through a simulation~\cite{Aad:2010ah} of the ATLAS detector geometry and response 
using \textsc{Geant4}~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh}. A faster simulation, where the full \textsc{Geant4} simulation of
the calorimeter response is replaced by a detailed parameterisation of the shower shapes~\cite{FastCaloSim},
was adopted for some of the samples used to estimate systematic uncertainties in background modelling.
Simulated events were processed through the same reconstruction software as the data, and corrections were applied so that the object identification 
efficiencies, energy scales and energy resolutions match those determined from data control samples.

%This kind of event is modelled by data-driven ABCD method
%by cutting on $\met$ and the tight lepton isolation using PLIV, which is widely used in ATLAS physics analyses.

%\subsubsection{Fake $\tau$-lepton candidates}
%\label{sec:faketaus}
%The background with one or more fake $\had$ candidates mainly arises from $\ttbar$ or
%multijet production, depending on the search channel. 
%Studies based on the simulation show that, for all the above processes, fake $\had$ candidates primarily result from the 
%misidentification of light-quark jets, with the contribution from $b$-quarks and gluon jets playing a subdominant role.
%It is also found that the fake rate decreases for all jet flavours as the $\had$ candidate $\pt$ increases.

%In the hadronic channels, this background is estimated partially from data by defining control regions (CR) enriched in fake $\had$ candidates via loosened $\had$ requirements with% proper fake factors and partially from monte carlo. These CRs do not overlap with the main search regions (SRs), discussed in Section~\ref{sec:strategy_Htautau}. The CR selection %requirements are analogous to those used to define the different SRs, except that the trailing $\had$ candidate is required to fail the medium $\had$ identification.

%In the leptonic channels, the events with real electron or muon and fake taus are modelled by calibrated monte carlo with scale factors derived from the dedicated $t\bar t$
%control regions ($CR_{tt}$) using the SM $t\bar t$ decay of dilepton events and semileptonically double-btagged lepton-jet events.
%The calibration is done depending on different source of the fake taus and \pt. The calibration factor are derived in the dedicated control regions discussed in Section~\ref{sec:st%rategy_Htautau}.

The $tt(qH)$ and $tH$ signal being probed are characterised by the presence of $\tau$-leptons from the decay of 
the Higgs boson, where the remaining top quark decays into $Wb$. There is an additional $q$-jet from the FCNC $t\to qH$ decay in the top pair production. 
%at least  four (three) jets in the decay (production) mode, only one of which originates from a $b$-quark.
If the $W$ boson or one of the $\tau$-leptons decays leptonically, an isolated electron or muon, together with significant $\met$ is also expected.
In a significant fraction of the events, the lowest $\pt$ jet from the hadronic $W$ boson decay fails the minimum $\pt$ requirement of $25~\gev$,
resulting in only three reconstructed jets where the production mode is dominant. 
%some signal events mixed with production mode having only three reconstructed jets.
In order to optimise the sensitivity of the search, the selected events are categorised into seven SRs based on the number of light leptons,
$\had$ candidates, and on the number of light flavored jets:

%This event categorisation is primarily motivated by the different quality of the event kinematic reconstruction, depending on the amount 
%of $\met$ in the event (larger in $\lephad$ events compared with $\hadhad$ events), and whether a jet from the hadronic top-quark decay %is missing or not (events with exactly three jets or at least four jets).
This event categorisation is primarily motivated by optimizing the sensitivity in each signal region that targets either leptonic or hadronic top-quark
decays as well as the Higgs decays into either $\lephad$ or $\hadhad$ final states.   
The event kinematic reconstruction is used in the $t_h\hadhad$ and $t_h\lephad$ channels to suppress the background by constraining the
di-tau mass and the missing transverse energy in the event~\cite{Chen:2015nta}.
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend %based on the strategy used in Ref.~\cite{Chen:2015nta}, and is summarised below.

For the $t_ht(qH)$ events, the jet from $t\to qH$, denoted as the FCNC jet ($q$-jet), should be a hard narrow jet from the
decay chain $t\to qH\to q\tau\tau$, with taus reconstructed as $\lephad$ or $\hadhad$.
There should be at least four jets among which the one with the smaller angular distance to the visible decay of the di-tau,
is considered as the $q$-jet since the FCNC top decay products are likely boosted closer together than other jets. 
If there are more than two jets besides the $q$- and $b$-jet, the jets from $W$ boson decay are chosen from the combination
with the invariant mass closest to the $W$ boson mass. There is the chance that one of the jets fails the $\pt$ requirement and \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend not reconstructed.
This kind of events will fall into $t_hH$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{final state}\DIFaddend .
%while the FCNC top resonance is
%still reconstructable that the missing jet is likely from the decay of $W$ boson.
%given the big chance that the jet which is missing is from $W$ decay.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In the $t_hH$ events, there }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{There }\DIFaddend are three jets coming from top hadronic decay including the $b$-jet and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a pair of }\DIFaddend opposite-sign \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\had$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{taus }\DIFaddend from the Higgs boson decay, where
both $t_h$ and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{H }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$H$ }\DIFaddend can be reconstructed.  
%. So a Higgs resonance formed by the taus and a top resonance formed by
%the jets are expected.

The four-momenta of the invisible decay products from the decay of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tau-leptons 
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\tau$-leptons 
}\DIFaddend are estimated using a kinematics fit. The fit is done by minimising a $\chi^2$ function based on the Gaussian constraints on the Higgs boson mass and the
measured $\met$ within their expected resolutions. The resolution on the Higgs boson mass is assumed to be $20~\gev$, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{respectively, }\DIFdelend while the resolution on the measured $\met$ is parameterised as a linear function of 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\sqrt{\sum E_T}$, where $\sum E_T$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\sqrt{\sum E_{\text{T}}}$, where $\sum E_{\text{T}}$ }\DIFaddend is the scalar sum of the $\pt$ of all physics objects contributing to the $\met$ reconstruction~\cite{Aaboud:2018tkc}.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{four-momentum }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$\pt$ }\DIFaddend of the parent top quarks \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend are determined with better resolution in the signal events.

in Section~\ref{sec:tmva}.

%With the event topology reconstructed, a number of variables are defined for signal and background separation used in the multivariate analysis discussed below.

%DIF < In the  $t_lt(qH)$ and $t_lH$ signal, the additional $q$ jet in the decay mode can still be found, but since the $W$ boson decays leptonically, there is a neutrino with large momentum and the flying direction is unknown.

\DIFadd{Most background processes are modelled using MC simulation.
After the event preselection, the main background is $\ttbar$ production, often in association with jets, denoted by $\ttbar$+jets in the following.
Small contributions arise from single-top-quark, $W/Z$+jets, multi-jet and diboson ($WW,WZ,ZZ$) production, as well as from the associated 
production of a vector boson $V$ ($V=W,Z$) or a Higgs boson and a $\ttbar$ pair ($\ttbar V$ and $\ttbar H$). All backgrounds 
with prompt leptons, i.e.\ those originating from the decay of a $W$ boson, a $Z$ boson, or a $\tau$-lepton,
are estimated using samples of simulated events and initially normalised to their theoretical cross sections.
In the simulation, the top-quark and SM Higgs boson masses are set to $172.5~\gev$ and $125~\gev$, respectively,
and the Higgs boson is forced to decay into $H\to \tau\tau$ with branching ratio calculated using }\textsc{\DIFadd{Hdecay}}\DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddbegin \label{sec:faketaus}
\DIFadd{The background with one or more fake tau candidates mainly arises from $\ttbar$ or
multi-jet production, depending on the search channels.
Studies based on simulation show that, for all the above processes, fake tau candidates primarily result from the
misidentification of light jets and $b$-quark jets.
It is also found that the fake rate decreases for all jet flavours as the tau candidate $\pt$ increases.
}

\DIFadd{In the leptonic channels, the events with prompt electron or muon and fake taus are modelled by calibrating MC with scale factors (SF)
derived from the dedicated $t\bar t$
control regions (CRtt) using dileptonic decays of $t\bar t$ events and semileptonic decays of $t\bar t$ events with two
$b$-jets, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:srcr}. 	
%DIF > the SM $t\bar t$ decay of dilepton events and semileptonically double-btagged lepton-jet events, summarized in Table~\ref{tab:srcr},
%DIF > aimed at fake taus from different origins.
There are four kinds of fake taus that need to be calibrated: Type-1 fake taus from $W$-jets ($\tau_{W}$)
with opposite-sign (OS) of charge to the light lepton;
Type-2 $\tau_{W}$'s with same-sign (SS) charge to the light lepton; Type-3 fake taus originating from $b$-hadron decays; Type-4 fake taus from light-flavour hadron decays.
The control regions are defined similar to the signal regions but with an additional $b$-jet or light lepton.
%DIF > $t_{\ell}t_{\ell}1b\thad$, $t_{\ell}t_{\ell}2b\thad$, $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-2jSS, $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-2jOS, $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-3jSS, and $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-3jOS.
The dilepton regions ($t_{\ell}t_{\ell}1b\thad$ and $t_{\ell}t_{\ell}2b\thad$) are used to calibrate Type-3 and Type-4 fake taus. The semileptonic
regions ($t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-2jOS and $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-3jOS) where $\thad$ and light lepton have opposite charge are used to calibrate Type-1 fake taus.
Similarly for Type-2, the semileptonic regions ($t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-2jSS and $t_{\ell}t_h2b\thad$-3jSS) where $\thad$ and light lepton have same charge are used.
A simultaneous fit to data is made to derive the scale factors for fake taus in MC, which consist of total of 24 parameters
depending on four types, three $\pt$ bins, two bins for 1- and 3-prong taus separately.
These scale factors are then used to correct the MC estimated fakes in the corresponding  signal regions with a single $b$-jet.
In the $t_{\ell}\thadhad$ channel, both taus can be misidentified, so the calibration is applied to each tau separately, following the same procedure used in the $\tlhad$ channel.
%DIF > using the lepton and fake tau charges, then the scale factors are multiplied together.
The nominal value of scale factors will vary according to their uncertainties in the final fit.
%DIF > In the control regions with single lepton, $\met > 20$GeV and at least 2 light jets and 2 b-tagged jets are required to ensure that QCD contribution is negligible.
%DIF > The calibration is done depending on different source of the fake taus and \pt. The calibration factor are derived in the dedicated
%DIF > control regions discussed in Section~\ref{sec:strategy_Htautau}.
}

\DIFadd{In the hadronic channels, the contribution of fakes is estimated partially from data by defining control regions (CR)
enriched in misidentified
tau candidates via loosened tau requirements with proper fake factors and partially from MC~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2021-044}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
These CRs do not overlap with the main signal regions, discussed in Section~\ref{sec:strategy_Htautau}.
The CR selection requirements are analogous to those used to define signal regions, except
that the subleading tau candidate is required to fail the medium tau identification, but it still passes a loose requirement.
The contribution of fakes with subleading tau candidate can be calculated by rescaling the templates of loose taus in the CR
with fake factors (FF).
The templates are produced by subtracting all MC background contributions with real subleading taus from data.
The FFs are computed as
the ratio of the Data-MC ($\mathrm{real~tau}$) yields in which the tau candidate is passed or failed the medium tau ID selection
in the $W$+jets control region.
%DIF > passing to failing the medium tau ID in the $W$+jets control region.
%DIF > We have compared
FFs obtained from the $W$+jets and from the same-sign $\thadhad$ control regions are compared and the differences are treated as a systematic uncertainty.
}

\subsection{\DIFadd{Background with fake light leptons}}
\DIFadd{The background originating from non-prompt or misidentified light leptons is primarily from the multi-jet production.
%DIF > Electrons and muons only appear in the leptonic channels where exactly one electron or muon and at least one $\had$ are required.
%DIF > Since the rate of $\had$ candidate is much larger than for electron or muon, in the majority of the fake lepton events, the $\had$ candidate is misidentified and
%DIF > the electron or muon is prompt based on MC studies.
%DIF > However the multi-jet background has large event rate and can contribute with both electron or muon and $\had$ faked, especially to $t_{\ell}\had$ where the fake-lepton dominates. and the jet multiplicity is low.
The contribution from these events is estimated with a data-driven method called ABCD.
The estimate is based on the number of tight and loose light-leptons that passed and failed the PLIV cut in the low and high $\met$ regions. The number of
fake light leptons in the signal region is evaluated by scaling the number of loose leptons in the high $\met$ region by the ratio of tight and loose leptons in the
low $\met$ region. The contributions of prompt leptons and calibrated fake taus in the number of tight and loose leptons are subtracted using MC simulation.
A closure test is made for the background estimations in the signal depleted low BDT regions. The data are in good agreement with the background prediction in the
$t_{\ell}\had$ channels where the fake light leptons are important, while they are negligible in other leptonic channels.

Boosted decision trees (BDT) \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{implemented in the TMVA framework}\DIFaddend ~\cite{Hocker:2007ht} are used in each SR to improve the separation between signal and background. 
%The separate training exploits differences in event kinematics across SRs.  
%draft 1 version
In the training, all signal events from $tt(qH)$ and $tH$ are merged together for $tuH$ and $tcH$. All background sources from SM processes
(including both real and fake \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\had$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tau }\DIFaddend contributions) are also used in the training.

A large set of potential variables are investigated in each SR separately. The discrimination of a given variable is quantified by the "separation"(measures the degree of overlap between background and signal shape) and "importance"(depicts the power of the variable to the classification of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{two distributions}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the events}\DIFaddend ) provided by the TMVA package~\cite{Hocker:2007ht}, and only those variables whose importance is \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{large }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{larger }\DIFaddend than 2\% were kept.
The BDT input variables in each SR and their importance are listed in Table~\ref{tab:importance}. The discriminating variables used are:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\met$ is the missing transverse momentum.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{${\pt}_{\tauhadvis} $ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{${\pt}_{\tau1} $ }\DIFaddend is the transverse momentum of the leading tau candidate.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{${\pt}_{\text{sub}-\tau}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{${\pt}_{\tau2}$ }\DIFaddend is the transverse momentum of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{sub-leading }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{subleading }\DIFaddend tau candidate.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{${\pt}_{\ell}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{${\pt}^{\ell}$ }\DIFaddend is the transverse momentum of the leading light lepton.
\item $\chi^2$ derived from the kinematic fit of the neutrino momentum.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$m_{t,\text{SM}}$ is the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$m_{\text{bjj},\text{fit}}$ is the fitted }\DIFaddend invariant mass of the $b$-jet and the two jets from the $W$ decay, and reflects the top mass in the decay $t\to Wb \to j_1j_2b$. This variable is only defined for the 4-jet $t_hH$ and $t_ht(qH)$ events.
\item \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$m^{T}_{\text{W}}$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$m^{W}_{\text{T}}$ }\DIFaddend is the transverse mass calculated from the lepton and $\met$ in the leptonic channels, defined as
\begin{equation}
m\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{^{T}_{\text{W}} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{^{W}_{\text{T}} }\DIFaddend = \sqrt{2 {\pt}_{\ell} E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}} \left(1-\cos\Delta\phi_{\ell,\text{miss}} \right)},  
\end{equation}
where $\Delta\phi_{\ell,\text{miss}}$ is the azimuth angle between the light-lepton and $\met$.

The dilepton regions ($t_lt_l1b\thad$ and $t_lt_l2b\thad$) are used to calibrate Type-3 and Type-4 fake taus. The semileptonic
regions ($t_lt_h2b\thad$-2jOS and $t_lt_h2b\thad$-3jOS) where $\thad$ and light lepton have opposite charge are used to calibrate Type-1 fake taus.
Similarly for Type-2, the semileptonic regions ($t_lt_h2b\thad$-2jSS and $t_lt_h2b\thad$-3jSS) where $\thad$ and light lepton have same charge are used.
A simultaneous fit to data is made to derive the scale factors for fake taus in MC, which consist of total of 24 parameters
depending on four types, three $\pt$ bins, two bins for 1- and 3-prong taus separately.
These scale factors are then used to correct the MC estimated fakes in the corresponding  signal regions with a single $b$-jet.

The contribution of fakes with subleading $\had$ candidate can be calculated by rescaling the templates of Loose taus in the CR
with proper fake factors (FF).
The templates are produced by subtracting all MC background contributions with real sub-leading taus from data.
The FFs are computed as
the ratio of the Data-MC ($\mathrm{real~tau}$) yields passing to failing the medium tau ID in the $W$+jets control region. We have compared
FF obtained from the $W$+jets and the same-sign $\thadhad$ control regions and the differences are treated as a systematic uncertainty.

The estimate is based on the number of tight and loose light-leptons that passed and failed the PLIV cut in the low and high $\met$ regions. The number of
fake light leptons in the signal region is evaluated by scaling the number of loose leptons in the high $\met$ region by the ratio of tight and loose leptons in the
low $\met$ region. The contributions of prompt leptons and calibrated $\had$ fakes in the number of tight and loose leptons are subtracted using MC simulation.

Several sources of systematic uncertainty that can affect the normalisation of signal 
and background and/or the shape of their corresponding discriminant distributions are considered.
Each source is considered to be uncorrelated with the other sources.  
Correlations of a given systematic uncertainty are maintained across processes and channels 
as appropriate. The following sections describe the systematic uncertainties considered.

\subsection{Luminosity}
\label{sec:syst_lumi}

The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 1.7\%, affecting the overall normalisation of all processes estimated from the simulation. 
It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2016hhf}, and using the LUCID-2 detector 
for the baseline luminosity measurements \cite{Avoni:2018iuv}, from a calibration of the luminosity scale using $x$--$y$ beam-separation scans.

\subsection{Reconstructed objects}
\label{sec:syst_objects}

Uncertainties associated with electrons, muons, and $\had$ candidates arise from the trigger, reconstruction,  
identification and isolation (in the case of electrons and muons) efficiencies, as well as the momentum scale and resolution. 
These are measured using $Z\to \ell^+\ell^-$ and $J/\psi\to \ell^+\ell^-$ events ($\ell =e, \mu$)~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2016-024,Aad:2016jkr} 
in the case of electrons and muons, and using $Z\to \tau^+\tau^-$ events in the case of $\had$ candidates~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2017-029}.

Uncertainties associated with jets arise from the jet energy scale
and resolution, and the efficiency to pass the JVT requirements. 
The largest contribution results from the jet energy scale, whose uncertainty dependence on jet $\pt$ and $\eta$, jet flavour, and pile-up treatment, 
is split into 43 uncorrelated components that are treated independently~\cite{Aaboud:2017jcu}. The total JES uncertainty is
below 5\% for most jets and below 1\% for central jets with $\pt$ between 300 GeV and 2 TeV. The difference between the JER
in data and MC is represented by one NP. It is applied on the MC by smearing the jet $\pt$ within the prescribed uncertainty.

Uncertainties associated with energy scales and resolutions of leptons and jets 
are propagated to $\met$. Additional uncertainties originating from the modelling 
of the underlying event, in particular its impact on the $\pt$ scale and resolution 
of unclustered energy, are negligible.

Efficiencies to tag $b$-jets and $c$-jets in the simulation are corrected to match the efficiencies in data by $\pt$-dependent factors,
whereas the light-jet efficiency is scaled by $\pt$- and $\eta$-dependent factors.
The $b$-jet efficiency is measured in a data sample enriched in $\ttbar$ events~\cite{Aad:2019epj79}, %EPJ C79(2019)970 {Aaboud:2018xwy},
  while the $c$-jet efficiency is measured
using $\ttbar$ events~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-001} or $W$+$c$-jet events~\cite{Aad:2015ydr}. 
The light-jet efficiency is measured in a multi-jet data sample enriched in light-flavour jets~\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2018-006}.
The uncertainties in these scale factors include a total of 44 independent sources affecting $b$-jets, 19 source affecting $c$-jets, and 19 sources affecting light-jets. 
These systematic uncertainties are taken as uncorrelated between $b$-jets, $c$-jets, and light-jets.

The uncertainty on the pileup reweighing is evaluated by varying the pileup scale factors
by 1$\sigma$ based on the reweighing of the average interactions per bunch crossing. However, this
uncertainty is highly correlated with the luminosity uncertainty and may be an overestimate.

\subsection{Background modelling}
\label{sec:syst_bkgmodeling}

A number of sources of systematic uncertainty affecting the modelling of $t\bar{t}$+jets are considered: the choice of the renormalisation and factorisation scale in the matrix-element calculation, the choice of the matching scale when matching the matrix elements to the parton show generator, the uncertainty in the value of $\alpha_s$ when modeling initial-state radiation (ISR), the choice of the renormalisation scale when modeling final-state radiation (FSR).
%%An uncertainty of  6\% is assigned to the inclusive $\ttbar$ production
%%cross section~\cite{Czakon:2011xx}, including contributions from varying the factorisation and renormalisation 
%%scales, as well as from the top-quark mass, the PDF and $\alpha_{\textrm{S}}$. The latter two represent the largest contribution 
%%to the overall theoretical uncertainty in the cross section and were calculated using the PDF4LHC prescription~\cite{Botje:2011sn} 
%%with the NNPDF3.0(NLO), CT10 NNLO~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Gao:2013xoa} and NNPDF2.3(LO) 5F FFN~\cite{Ball:2012cx} PDF sets.

The hdamp parameter (which controls the amount of radiation produced by the parton shower in
POWHEG-BOX v2) is set to 1.5$m_t$ in the nominal case. Alternative samples are generated with hdamp=3$m_t$. The
difference between two samples is treated as one of the systematics as ``$t\bar{t}$ hdamp''. 
%The uncertainty associated with the choice of NLO generator is derived by comparing the nominal prediction from
%{\powheg}+{\pythiaeight} with a prediction from \textsc{Sherpa}~2.2.1. For the latter, the matrix-element calculation is performed 
%for up to two partons at NLO and up to four partons at LO using \textsc{Comix} and \textsc{OpenLoops}, and
%merged with the {\sherpa} parton shower using the ME+PS@NLO prescription.

The uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation (PS \& Had) model is derived 
by comparing the predictions from {\powheg} interfaced either to {\pythiaeight} or {\herwig7}.
The latter uses the MMHT2014 LO~\cite{Harland-Lang:2014zoa} PDF set in combination with the H7UE tune~\cite{Bellm:2015jjp}.
The uncertainty in the modelling of additional radiation from the PS are assessed by
varying the corresponding parameter of the A14 set~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-004} and by varying the radiation renormalisation and factorisation scales
by a factor of 2.0 and 0.5, respectively. 
%The uncertainty in the modelling of additional radiation is assessed with two alternative {\powheg}+{\pythiaeight} samples:
%a sample with increased radiation (referred to as radHi) is obtained by decreasing the renormalisation and factorisation scales  
%by a factor of two, %doubling the $h_{\textrm{damp}}$ parameter,
%and using the Var3c upward variation of the A14 parameter set;
%a sample with decreased radiation (referred to as radLow) is obtained by increasing the scales by a factor of two  %and using the Var3c downward variation of the A14 set~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2016-004}.


Another significant background in hadronic channel stems from the $Z\rightarrow \tau\tau$ samples, several sources of uncertainty are
considered for these samples: the PDF variation considering the standard deviation of the 100 NNPDF replicas event weights
of NNPDF3.0nnlo~\cite{Ball:2015NNPDF} PDF
set used in Sherpa, renormalisation ($\mu_{R}$) and factorisation scales ($\mu_{F}$), jet-to-parton matching uncertainty, resummation scale uncertainty,
variation in the choice of $\alpha_{S}$, alternative PDF variation evaluated comparing predictions from NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF set (nominal)
with MMHT2014nnlo68cl and CT14nnlo~\cite{Lai:2010vv,Gao:2013xoa} PDF sets.

Uncertainties affecting the normalisation of the $V$+jets background are estimated separately for $V$+light-jets, $V$+$\geq$1$c$+jets,
and $V$+$\geq$1$b$+jets subprocesses. The total normalisation uncertainty of $V$+jets processes is estimated \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{to be }\DIFaddend approximately 30\% by comparing the
data and total background prediction in the different analysis regions considered, but requiring exactly zero $b$-jet.
%Agreement between data and predicted background 
%in these modified regions, which are dominated by $V$+light-jets, is found to be within approximately 30\%. This bound is taken to 
%be the normalisation uncertainty, correlated across all $V$+jets subprocesses. 
%Since {\sherpa}~2.2 has been found to underestimate $V$+heavy-flavour production by about a factor
%of 1.3~\cite{Aaboud:2017xsd}, additional 30\% normalisation uncertainties are assumed for $V$+$\geq$1$c$+jets and $V$+$\geq$1$b$+jets
%subprocesses, considered uncorrelated between them.

%To estimate the uncertainty originating from ISR modelling in the single top samples, the same procedure as $t\bar{t}$ is used. One NP reflects the symmetrised effect of the two shower variations Var3cDown and Var3cUp, and the other NP with name ``scale'' describe the symmetrised effect from the independent variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scale. The impact of the uncertainty from FSR modelling is estimated by reweighing the nominal single top sample. The two variations $\mu^{FSR}_{R} \times 0.5$ and $\mu^{FSR}_{R} \times 2$ are considered.  The standard deviation of 100 NNPDF3.0nnlo variations is calculated Uncertainties on the PDF are evaluated following the recommended prescription in Ref.~\cite{ttRun2}.

%The values of the scale-parameters $\mu_{f}$ and $\mu_{f}$ are varied by factors of 2.0 and 0.5 with respect to their default values to obtain the uncertainties related to the renormalization and factorization scales in ttV samples. Uncertainties on the PDF are evaluated following the same procedure in Ref.~\cite{ttZRun2}.

%Following the recommendations of the PMG group, the uncertainties to be considered for diboson background include~\cite{dibosonRes} scale variations of the renormalization and factorization scale,
%PDF variations and $\alpha_{S}$ variations.

%A $+5.8\%-9.2\%$ normalization uncertainty is considered for the ttH background, corresponding to the scale and $\alpha_{S}$ uncertainties in the NLO cross-section computation. A constant PDF uncertainty of $\pm3.6$\% is assumed, as it was done for the previous measurement. Therefore, a overall systematics with variation 9\% is entered in the final fit model~\cite{ttZRun2}.

Uncertainties affecting the modelling of the single-top-quark background include a 
$+5\%$/$-4\%$ uncertainty of the total cross section estimated as a weighted average 
of the theoretical uncertainties in $t$-, $tW$- and $s$-channel production~\cite{Kidonakis:2011wy,Kidonakis:2010ux,Kidonakis:2010tc}.
Additional uncertainties associated with the parton shower, hadronisation and ISR/FSR radiations are also considered using the same procedure
as in $t\bar t$. Uncertainties of the diboson background normalisation include variations of the renormalization and factorization scale, NNPDF3.0nnlo variations and $\alpha_{S}$ variations. Uncertainties of the $\ttbar V$ and $\ttbar H$ cross sections are 12\% and $+5.8\%-9.2\%$, respectively,
from the uncertainties of their respective NLO theoretical cross sections~\cite{ttZRun2}. 

%by comparing the nominal
%%%samples with alternative samples where generator parameters are varied.
%%%For the $t$- and $tW$-channel processes, an uncertainty due to the choice of parton shower and hadronisation model is derived 
%%%by comparing events produced by {\powheg} interfaced to {\pythia}~8 or {\herwigpp}.
%%%These uncertainties are treated as fully correlated among single-top-quark production processes, but uncorrelated with the
%%%corresponding uncertainty of the $\ttbar$+jets background.
%%%An additional systematic uncertainty in $tW$-channel production concerning the separation 
%%%between $t\bar{t}$ and $tW$ at NLO is assessed by comparing
%%%the nominal sample, which uses the diagram removal scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi}, with an alternative sample
%%%using the diagram subtraction scheme~\cite{Frixione:2008yi}.

%%%%(it is assumed that two jets originate from the $W/Z$ decay, as in $WW/WZ \to \ell \nu jj$). 
%%%%Therefore, the total normalisation uncertainty is $5\% \oplus \sqrt{N-2}\times 24\%$, where $N$ is the selected jet multiplicity,  
%%%%resulting in 34\%, 42\%, and 48\%, for events with exactly 4 jets, exactly 5 jets, and $\geq$6 jets, respectively. 
%%%%Recent comparisons between data and {\sherpa}~2.1.1 for $WZ(\to \ell\nu\ell\ell) + \geq$4 jets show
%%%%agreement within the experimental uncertainty of approximately 40\%~\cite{Aaboud:2016yus}, which further justifies the above uncertainty.
%%%%Given the very small contribution of this background to the total prediction, the final result is not affected by the assumed modelling
%%%%uncertainties.
%%%%



The statistical uncertainties on the fake \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\had$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tau }\DIFaddend background calibration in the leptonic channel are applied with uncorrelated uncertainties for different fake \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\had$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tau }\DIFaddend sources and
different $\pt$ slices. The uncertainty of the ABCD method is applied with a normalisation factor for muon and electron respectively considering both,
its statistical fluctuation and the differences between signal regions.
The uncertainties in the fake factor method applied in hadronic channel includes statistical uncertainties of each fake factor and different sets of fake factors derived from different signal depleted CRs.

% Statistical analysis
\section{Statistical analysis}
\label{sec:stat_analysis}


The final \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{BDT discriminant distributions across all analysis regions considered }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{discriminant distributions are the BDT outputs of all the considered analysis regions. They }\DIFaddend are jointly analysed to test for the 
presence of a signal. The statistical analysis uses a binned likelihood function ${\cal L}(\mu,\theta)$ constructed as
a product of Poisson probability terms over all bins considered in the search. This function depends
on the signal-strength parameter $\mu$, defined as a factor multiplying the expected yield of $tH$ and $tt(qH)$ signal events
normalised to a reference branching ratio $\BR_{\mathrm{ref}}(t\to qH)=0.1\%$,
and $\theta$, a set of nuisance parameters that encode the effect of systematic uncertainties on the signal and background expectations. 
Therefore, the expected total number of events in a given bin depends on $\mu$ and $\theta$. 
All nuisance parameters are subject to Gaussian constraints in the likelihood.
For a given value of $\mu$, the nuisance parameters $\theta$ allow variations of the expectations for signal and background
according to the corresponding systematic uncertainties, and their fitted values result in the deviations from
the nominal expectations that globally provide the best fit to the data.
This procedure allows a reduction of the impact of systematic uncertainties on 
the search sensitivity by taking advantage of the highly populated background-dominated bins included in the likelihood fit.
%To verify the improved background prediction, fits under the background-only hypothesis are performed, 
%and differences between the data and the post-fit background prediction are checked 
%using kinematic variables other than the ones used in the fit. 
Statistical uncertainties in each bin of the predicted final discriminant distributions are taken into account by dedicated parameters in the fit.     
The best-fit $\BR(t\to qH)$ is obtained by performing a binned likelihood fit to the data under the signal-plus-background
hypothesis, maximising the likelihood function ${\cal L}(\mu,\theta)$ over $\mu$ and $\theta$.

The fitting procedure was initially validated through extensive studies using pseudo data, defined as the sum of all predicted backgrounds 
plus an injected signal of variable strength, as well as by performing fits to real data where bins of the final discriminant variable with 
a signal contamination above 10\% are excluded (referred to as blinding requirements).
In both cases, the robustness of the model for systematic uncertainties is established by verifying the stability of the fitted background 
when varying assumptions about some of the leading sources of uncertainty. 
After this, the blinding requirements
are removed in the data and a fit under the signal-plus-background hypothesis is performed. Further checks involve the comparison of the fitted 
nuisance parameters before and after removal of the blinding requirements, and their values are found to be consistent. In addition, it is verified that the 
fit is able to correctly determine the strength of a simulated signal injected into the real data.

The test statistic $q_\mu$ is defined as the profile likelihood ratio, 
$q_\mu = -2\ln({\cal L}(\mu,{\hat{\theta}}_\mu)/{\cal L}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\theta}))$,
where $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are the values of the parameters that
maximise the likelihood function (subject to the constraint $0\leq \hat{\mu} \leq \mu$), and ${\hat{\theta}}_\mu$ are the values of the
nuisance parameters that maximise the likelihood function for a given value of $\mu$. 
The test statistic $q_\mu$ is evaluated with the {\textsc RooFit} package~\cite{Verkerke:2003ir,RooFitManual}.
%A related statistic is used to determine whether the observed data is compatible with the background-only hypothesis (the so-called discovery test)  
%by setting $\mu=0$ in the profile likelihood ratio and leaving $\hat{\mu}$ unconstrained: $q_0 = -2\ln({\cal L}(0,{\hat{\theta}}_0)/{\cal L}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\theta}))$.
%The $p$-value (referred to as $p_0$), representing the level of agreement between the data and the background-only hypothesis, is estimated by integrating
%%representing the probability of the data being compatible with the background-only hypothesis is estimated by integrating
%%the distribution of $q_0$ obtained from background-only pseudo-experiments, approximated using the asymptotic formulae given in Refs.~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, 
%the distribution of $q_0$ based on the asymptotic formulae in Ref.~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, 
%above the observed value of $q_0$ in the data. 
%%The observed $p_0$-value is checked for each explored signal scenario.
%%In the case of the data being compatible with the background-only hypothesis, 
%Upper limits on $\mu$, and thus on 
%$\BR(t\to Hq)$, are derived by using $q_\mu$ in the CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ method~\cite{Junk:1999kv,Read:2002hq}.
%For a given signal scenario, values of the $\BR(t\to Hq)$ yielding CL$_{\textrm{s}} < 0.05$, 
%where CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ is computed using the asymptotic approximation~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, are excluded at $\geq 95\%$ CL.

%In the absence of signal,
Exclusion limits are set on $\mu$ , and thus on
$\BR(t\to qH)$, are derived by using $q_\mu$ in the CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ method~\cite{Junk:1999kv,Read:2002hq}.
For a given signal scenario, values of the $\BR(t\to qH)$ yielding CL$_{\textrm{s}} < 0.05$,
where CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ is computed using the asymptotic approximation~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, are excluded at $\geq 95\%$ CL.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section presents the results obtained from the individual channels, as well as their combination,
following the statistical analysis discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stat_analysis}.

A binned likelihood fit under the signal-plus-background hypothesis is performed on the BDT discriminant distributions in the seven 
analysis regions considered. The unconstrained parameter of the fit is the signal strength.
%and four independent parameters associated with the normalisation of the fake $\had$ background in each of the analysis regions. 
No significant pulls or constraints are obtained for the fitted nuisance parameters, resulting in a post-fit background prediction in each analysis region that is
very close to the pre-fit prediction, albeit with reduced uncertainties due to the anti-correlations among sources of systematic uncertainty resulting from the fit.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Figure~\ref{fig:Bonlyfit_data} shows a background only fit to the BDT discriminant distribution in the data.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Figure~\ref{fig:asimov_postfitbdtHu} and~\ref{fig:asimov_postfitbdtHc} }\DIFaddend show a post-fit with signal plus background (S+B) to the data for
the $tcH$ and $tuH$ search separately.
%both pre- and post-fit to data, in the case of the $\Hc$ search.  
%A similar comparison for the leptonic channel is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:tthML_trexPrefit} and \ref{fig:tthML_trexPrefit_1}.
The observed and predicted yields after fit to the data with background only are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:HtautauPostfitYieldsUnblind}.
%pre-fit and post-fit yields can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:prepostfit_yields_Htautau_appendix}.
A slight excess of data is observed above background with a significance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.6 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.3 }\DIFaddend $\sigma$, which is mainly in the most sensitive \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$t_l\thadhad$ }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$t_{\ell}\thadhad$ }\DIFaddend channel in the high BDT score region \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.

%Comparison between the data and prediction for the BDT discriminant distribution in the
%$\lephad$ channel, before and after the fit to data  (``Pre-Fit'' and ``Post-Fit'', respectively) under the signal-plus-background hypothesis.
%Shown are the ($\lephad$, 3j) region (a) pre-fit and (c) post-fit, and the ($\lephad$, $\geq$4j) region (b) pre-fit and (d) post-fit.
%The contributions with real $\had$ candidates from $\ttbar$,  $\ttbar V$, $\ttbar H$, and single-top-quark backgrounds are combined into
%a single background source referred to as ``Top (real $\had$)'', whereas the small contributions from 
%$Z\to \ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell = e, \mu$) and diboson backgrounds are combined into ``Other''. 
%In the pre-fit figures the expected $\Hc$ signal (solid red) corresponding to $\BR(t\to Hc)=1\%$ is also shown,
%added to the background prediction. In the post-fit figures, the $\Hc$ signal is normalised using the best-fit branching ratio, 
%$\BR(t\to Hc)=(-4.4^{+9.9}_{-8.5})\times 10^{-4}$.
%The bottom panels display the ratios of data to either the SM background prediction before the fit (``Bkg'')  or the total signal-plus-background
%prediction after the fit (``Pred''). 
%The hashed area represents the total uncertainty of the background. 
%In the case of the pre-fit background uncertainty, the normalisation uncertainty of the fake $\had$ background is not included.
%The results are given in terms of exclusion limits despite a small excess of data events above the background expectation is found.
Upper limits are derived using the CL$_{\textrm{s}}$ method~\cite{Junk:1999kv,Read:2002hq}, and  
observed (expected) 95\% CL limits are set on $\BR(t\to cH)$ and $\BR(t\to uH)$:
$\BR(t\to cH)<9.9 \times 10^{-4}\,(5.0 \times 10^{-4})$, assuming $\BR(t\to uH)=0$,and $\BR(t\to uH)<7.2 \times 10^{-4}\,(3.6 \times 10^{-4})$, assuming $\BR(t\to cH)=0$.
These results are dominated by the leptonic channels, which has a sensitivity a factor of two better than that of the hadronic channels.
The expected sensitivity has been improved upon the previous ATLAS result based on 36 fb$^{-1}$ of data using $H\to \tau\tau$ decay~\cite{fcnc36} by a factor of~5. A factor of~2 improvement in sensitivity comes from the larger dataset, and a further factor of~2.5 comes from including
additional leptonic channels, $tH$ production, and improved the analysis techniques.

%The best-fit normalisation factors for the fake $\had$ background are: $0.82 \pm 0.23$ in the ($\lephad$, 3j) region, $0.84^{+0.25}_{-0.28}$ in the ($\lephad$, $\geq$4j) region,
%$0.94^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$ in the ($\hadhad$, 3j) region, and $0.90 \pm 0.26$ in the ($\hadhad$, $\geq$4j) region.
%A similar fit is performed for the $tuH$ search, yielding $\BR(t\to Hu)=[xxx^{+yy}_{-yy}\,(\mathrm{stat})^{+zz}_{-zz}\,(\mathrm{syst})] \times 10^{-4}$,
%assuming $\BR(t\to Hc)=0$.
%The obtained normalisation factors for the fake $\had$ background agree within 1\% with those obtained by the $\Hc$ search.
In both cases, the results are dominated by the statistical uncertainty.
The main contributions to the total systematic uncertainty arise from the uncertainties on the measured $\BR(H\to \tautau)$ branching ratio,
affecting the normalization and factorization scales, $b$-tagging, the choice of parton shower and hadronization for $t\bar t$ modelling, and the fake $\had$ background estimation in the hadronic channels.

%The first set of combined results is obtained for each branching ratio separately, setting the other branching ratio to zero.
%The best-fit combined branching ratios are $\BR(t\to Hc)=[3.0^{+3.0}_{-2.7}\,(\mathrm{stat})^{+2.6}_{-2.1}\,(\mathrm{syst})] \times 10^{-4}$ and 
%$\BR(t\to Hu)=[4.2^{+3.2}_{-2.9}\,(\mathrm{stat})^{+2.6}_{-2.1}\,(\mathrm{syst})] \times 10^{-4}$.  
%%The difference between the central values of $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)$ originates from the ability of the $H \to b\bar{b}$ search to

%A comparison of the best-fit branching ratios for the individual searches and their combination is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:summary_printnum_hc} 
%for $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and Figure~\ref{fig:summary_printnum_hu} for $\BR(t\to Hu)$.

\DIFaddend Upper limits on the branching ratios $\BR(t\to qH)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated into upper limits on the dimension-6 (D6) operator Wilson coefficients appearing in the effective field theory Lagrangian for $tqH$ interaction~\cite{fcnc_production_theory}:
%
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_{EFT} = \frac{C^{i3}_{u\phi}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)(\bar{q_{i}}t)\tilde{\phi} + \frac{C^{3i}_{u\phi}}{\Lambda^{2}}(\phi^{\dagger}\phi)(\bar{t}q_{i})\tilde{\phi}
  \label{eq:eq01}
\end{equation}
%
where the subscript i= 1, 2 represents the generation of the light quark fields ($q=u, c$).
The branching ratio $\BR(t\to qH)$ is estimated as the ratio of its partial width to the SM $t \to Wb$ partial width including next-to-leading-order QCD corrections and the coefficients can be extracted as $C_{q\phi} = \sqrt{1946.6~\BR(t\to qH)}$~\cite{fcnc_production_theory}. The $C_{q\phi}$ coefficient corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the coefficients relative to the two possible chirality combinations of the quark fields,
$C_{q\phi} =\sqrt{(C^{i3}_{q\phi})^2 + (C^{3i}_{q\phi})^2}$~\cite{fcnc_production_theory}. The observed (expected) upper limits on the D6 Wilson coefficients from the combination of the searches are $C_{c\phi}<1.38\,(0.97)$ and $C_{u\phi}<1.18\,(0.83)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the new physics scale $\Lambda$ at 1~TeV}\DIFaddend . 

%Upper limits on the branching ratios $\BR(t\to Hq)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated into upper limits on the non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings $\lamHq$ 
%appearing in the Lagrangian~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}:
%\begin{equation*}
%{\cal L}_\mathrm{FCNC} = -\lambda_{t_\mathrm{L} q_\mathrm{R}} \bar{t}_\mathrm{L} q_\mathrm{R} H - \lambda_{q_\mathrm{L} t_\mathrm{R}} \bar{q}_\mathrm{L} t_\mathrm{R} H  + \mathrm{h.c.}
%\end{equation*}
%The branching ratio $\BR(t\to Hq)$ is estimated as the ratio of its partial width~\cite{Zhang:2013xya} to the SM $t \to Wb$ partial width~\cite{Denner:1990ns}, 
%which is assumed to be dominant. Both predicted partial widths include next-to-leading-order QCD corrections.
%Using the expression derived in Ref.~\cite{Aad:2014dya}, the coupling $|\lamHq|$ can be extracted as $| \lamHq | = (1.92 \pm 0.02) \sqrt{\BR(t\to Hq)}$.
%The $\lamHq$ coupling corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the couplings relative to the two possible chirality combinations of the quark fields, 
%$\lamHq \equiv \sqrt{ |\lambda_{t_\mathrm{L} q_\mathrm{R}}|^2 +   |\lambda_{q_\mathrm{L} t_\mathrm{R}}|^2 }$~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}.
%The observed (expected) upper limits on the couplings from the combination of the searches are $|\lamHc|<0.064\,(0.055)$ and $|\lamHu|<0.066\,(0.055)$.

A similar set of results can be obtained by simultaneously varying both branching ratios in the likelihood function.
Figure~\ref{fig:limits_combo_2D}(a) shows the 95\% CL upper limits on the branching ratios in the $\BR(t\to uH)$ versus $\BR(t\to cH)$ plane. 
%The small differences between the limiting values (on the $x$- and $y$-axes) of the branching ratio limits obtained in the two-dimensional scan and

%regarding the final discriminant, which in the two-dimensional case should be common to both signals, and its binning.
%\textbf{Add comment of what discriminant is used in this case and the caveat regarding the corresponding 1D limit.}

\section{Conclusion}

A search for flavour-changing neutral current processes involving a top quark, an up-type quark ($q=u, c$), and a SM Higgs boson is presented. FCNC $tqH$ interaction is searched for both in $t\bar{t}$ decay mode, where one top quark decays \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{following }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{according to the }\DIFaddend SM processes and the other one decays through $t\rightarrow Hq$, and in production mode ($pp\rightarrow tH$) with a single top quark produced via FCNC interaction where $t\to Wb$. The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The search selects events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates ($\tauhad$) or at least one $\tauhad$ with an additional lepton(e,$\mu$), a $b$-jet as well as multiple jets. Multivariate techniques based on BDT are used to distinguish the signal from the background on the basis of their different kinematics.
%The search sensitivities have been improved significantly compared to the previous analysis using 36$^{-1}$ of run-2 data~\cite{Aaboud2019SearchFT}. No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found.
A slight excess of data is observed above background with a significance of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.3}\DIFaddend $\sigma$.  
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We set }\DIFdelend 95\% CL upper limits \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{are set }\DIFaddend on the $t\to Hq$ branching ratios and the corresponding
dimension-6 operator Wilson coefficients in the effective $tqH$ couplings. 
%about a factor of 2 improvement to 95\% CL upper limits on the $t\to Hq$ branching ratios are reported in Table~\ref{tab:limits_summary}, along with the Wilson coefficients with respect to the previous partial run-2 results~\cite{Aaboud2019SearchFT}.
Observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits are set on the $t\to cH$ and $t\to uH$ branching ratios of $9.9\times10^{-4}$ ($5.0^{+2.2}_{-1.4}\times10^{-4}$) and $7.2\times10^{-4}$ ($3.6^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-4}$).
%The observed (expected) upper limits on the D6 Wilson coefficients from the combination of the searches are set to $C_{c\phi}<1.38\,(0.97)$ and $C_{u\phi}<1.18\,(0.83)$, respectively.
The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the dimension-6 operator Wilson coefficients in
the effective $tqH$ couplings are $C_{c\phi} <1.38\, (0.97)$ and $C_{u\phi} <1.18\, (0.83)$ \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{for the new physics scale $\Lambda$ at 1~TeV}\DIFaddend , respectively.
These results improve significantly upon previous ATLAS and CMS limits on the $t\rightarrow Hq$ branching ratios.
