\caption{$\Htautau$ search: Comparison between the data and predicted background for the distribution of some of the most
discriminating BDT input variables in the $\lephad$ channel before the fit to data (``Pre-Fit''). The distributions are shown for
$x_{1}^{\text{fit}}$ in (a) the ($\lephad$, 3j) region and (b) the ($\lephad$, $\geq$4j) region, and for
$x_{2}^{\text{fit}}$ in (c) the ($\lephad$, 3j)  region and (d) the ($\lephad$, $\geq$4j) region.
The contributions with real $\had$ candidates from $\ttbar$,  $\ttbar V$, $\ttbar H$, and single-top-quark backgrounds are combined into
a single background source referred to as ``Top (real $\had$)", whereas the small contributions from 
$Z\to \ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell = e, \mu$) and diboson backgrounds are combined into ``Other''. 
The expected $\Hc$ signal (solid red) corresponding to $\BR(t\to Hc)=1\%$ is also shown,
added to the background prediction.
%The first and the last bins in all figures contain the underflow and overflow respectively.
The bottom panel displays the ratio of data to the SM background (``Bkg'') prediction.
The hashed area represents the total uncertainty of the background, excluding the normalisation uncertainty of the fake $\had$ background, 
which is determined via a likelihood fit to data.}

\caption{$\Htautau$ search: Ranking of the nuisance parameters included in the fit according to their impact on the measured signal strength $\mu$, in
the case of the $\Hc$ search.
Only the 10 most highly ranked parameters are shown. Nuisance parameters corresponding to MC statistical uncertainties are not included here. 
The empty blue rectangles correspond to the pre-fit impact on $\mu$ and the filled blue ones to the post-fit impact on $\mu$, 
both referring to the upper scale. The impact of each nuisance parameter, $\Delta\mu$, is computed by comparing the nominal best-fit value of $\mu$ 
with the result of the fit when fixing the considered nuisance parameter to its best-fit value, $\hat{\theta}$, shifted by its pre-fit (post-fit) uncertainties 
$\pm\Delta\theta$ ($\pm\Delta\hat{\theta}$). The black points show the pulls of the nuisance parameters relative to their nominal values, $\theta_{0}$. 
These pulls and their relative post-fit errors, $\Delta\hat{\theta}/\Delta\theta$, refer to the lower scale.
The parameter $\mathrm{k}($Fake~$\had)$ refers to the floating normalisation of the fake $\had$ background, for which the pre-fit impact on $\mu$ is not defined, 
and for which both $\theta_{0}$ and $\Delta\theta$ are set to 1.
For experimental uncertainties that are decomposed into several independent sources, NP I and NP II correspond to the first and second nuisance parameters, 
ordered by its impact on $\mu$.}
