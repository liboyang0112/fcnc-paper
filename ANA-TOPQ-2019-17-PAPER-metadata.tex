\AtlasAbstract{%

A search for flavour-changing neutral current $tqH$ interactions with a top quark, an up-type quark ($q=u, c$), and the
Standard Model Higgs boson is presented. The Higgs boson decays to a pair of $\tau$-leptons, $H\rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$, is considered.
The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the 
CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$.
Two production processes are considered:  single top quark FCNC production in association with the Higgs boson ($pp\rightarrow tH$), and top quark pair production in
which one top quark decays into $Wb$ and the other top quark with FCNC decay of $t\rightarrow qH$. 
The search selects events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates ($\tauhad$) or at least one $\tauhad$ with an additional lepton(e,$\mu$),
as well as multiple jets.  
Multivariate techniques are used to separate the signal from the background on the basis of their different kinematics.
No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and 95\% CL upper limits on the $t\to qH$ branching ratios are derived.
Observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits are set on the $t\to cH$ and $t\to uH$ branching ratios of XXX ($0.046^{+0.020}_{-0.012}\%$) 
and XXX ($0.034^{+0.014}_{-0.012}\%$), respectively.
%The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the $|\lambda_{tcH}|$ and $|\lambda_{tuH}|$ couplings are 0.064 (0.055) and 0.066 (0.055), respectively. 
%These are the most restrictive direct bounds on $tqH$ interactions obtained so far.
