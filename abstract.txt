A search for flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) $tqH$ interactions involving a top quark, another up-type quark ($q=u,\, c$), and a
Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decaying into a $\tau$-lepton pair ($H\rightarrow \tau^+\tau^-$) is presented.
The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~TeV$ that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of
139 fb$^{-1}$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider.
Two processes are considered:  single top quark FCNC production in association with a Higgs boson ($pp\rightarrow tH$),
and top quark pair production in which one of top quarks decays into $Wb$ and the other decays into $qH$ through the FCNC interactions.
The search selects events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates ($\tau_{\text{had}}$) or at least one $\tau_{\text{had}}$
with an additional lepton (e,$\mu$), as well as multiple jets. Event kinematics are used to separate signal
from the background through a multivariate discriminant. A slight excess of data is observed with a significance of 2.3$\sigma$
above the expected SM background, and 95\% CL upper limits on the $t\to qH$ branching ratios are derived.
Observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits are set on the $t\to cH$ and $t\to uH$ branching ratios of
$9.4 \times 10^{-4}\, (4.8^{+2.2}_{-1.4}\times 10^{-4})$ and $6.9\times 10^{-4}\, (3.5^{+1.5}_{-1.0}\times 10^{-4})$, respectively.
The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the dimension-6 operator Wilson coefficients in
the effective $tqH$ couplings are $C_{c\phi} <1.35\, (0.97)$ and $C_{u\phi} <1.16\, (0.82)$, respectively.
