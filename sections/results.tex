This section presents the results obtained from the individual searches for $\Hq$, as well as their combination. 

\subsection{$\Hbb$ search}
\label{sec:results_Hbb}

Following the statistical analysis discussed in Section~\ref{sec:stat_analysis}, a binned likelihood fit under the signal-plus-background hypothesis 
is performed on the LH discriminant distributions in the nine analysis regions considered (see Section~\ref{sec:strategy_Hbb}).
In the 3b regions, which have the highest sensitivity, the full LH distribution is used with ten equidistant bins. In contrast, in the $\geq$4b regions,
which have limited data statistics and a small signal fraction, only two equidistant bins are used. Finally, in the 2b regions the total event yield
after applying a cut on the LH discriminant above 0.6, is used. 
%As discussed previously, the primary role of the 2b and $\geq$4b regions in
%the fit to data is to provide additional constraints to obtained an improved  $\ttbar$+light-jet and $\ttbin$ background predictions, with reduced
%uncertainties.

Figures~\ref{fig:prepostfit_unblinded_WbHc_3btagex} and~\ref{fig:prepostfit_unblinded_WbHc_4btagin} show a comparison 
of the data and prediction in the LH discriminant distribution in the 3b and $\geq$4b regions, 
both before and after performing the fit to data (denoted as “pre-fit” and “post-fit”, respectively), in the case of the $\Hc$ search.  
The post-fit yields can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:prepostfit_yields_Hbb_appendix}.
The best-fit branching ratio obtained is $\BR(t\to Hc)=[-0.01^{+0.23}_{-0.25}\,(\mathrm{stat+syst})]\%$,
assuming that $\BR(t\to Hu)=0$. 
A similar fit is performed for the $\Hu$ search, yielding $\BR(t\to Hu)=[0.02^{+0.27}_{-0.30}\,(\mathrm{stat+syst})]\%$,
assuming that $\BR(t\to Hc)=0$.  The different measured values for the two branching ratios is the result of the slightly different sensitivities
of the $\Hc$ and $\Hu$ searches, as discussed in Section~\ref{sec:event_categorisation}.
The total uncertainties in the measured branching ratios are dominated by systematic uncertainties.

%\textbf{Add discussion about corrections applied by the fit and reduction of systematic uncertainties.}
The large number of events in the analysis regions considered, together with their different background compositions, allows
the fit to place constraints on the combined effect of several sources of systematic uncertainty.
As a result, an improved background prediction is obtained with a significantly reduced uncertainty, not only in the 
signal-depleted regions, but also in the most sensitive analysis regions for this search, (4j, 3b) and (5j, 3b).
The regions with two $b$-tagged jets are used to constrain the leading uncertainties affecting the $\ttbar$+light-jets background prediction,
while the channels with $\geq$4 $b$-tagged jets are sensitive to the uncertainties affecting the $\ttbar$+HF background prediction.  
In particular, one of the main corrections applied by the fit is an increase of the $\ttbin$ normalisation by a factor of $1.17 \pm  0.15$ 
relative to the nominal prediction by adjusting the corresponding nuisance parameter.  The $\ttcin$ normalisation is also increased
by a factor of $1.34 \pm  0.40$. These corrections are in agreement with those found in Ref.~\cite{Aaboud:2017rss}.
Along with small adjustments to the leading nuisance parameters related to the $b$-tagging and $c$-tagging calibration,
as well as some nuisance parameters related to several $\ttbin$ and $\ttcin$ modelling uncertainties, this results in an improved 
agreement between data and prediction in the main search regions with three $b$-tagged jets.
The leading systematic uncertainties affecting the signal extraction by the fit are related to the $c$-tagging calibration,
followed by the $\ttbar$+light-jets PS \& Had uncertainty, the limited statistics of the simulated samples in some of the bins with 
the highest signal-to-background ratio, and the uncertainties affecting the $\ttbin$ normalisation and the 5F vs 4F comparison.

In the absence of a significant excess in data above the background expectation, 95\% CL limits are set on $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)$.
The observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits on the branching ratios 
are $\BR(t\to Hc)<0.42\%\,(0.40\%)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)<0.52\%\,(0.49\%)$.

%
%As an illustration, Figure~\ref{fig:ranking_bb_Hc} provides a summary of the leading 15 systematic uncertainties affecting the $\Hc$ search, 
%quantifying their impact on the signal strength $\mu$, both before and after the fit, and displaying the constraints
%provided by the data on the associated nuisance parameters. 
%The pre-fit impact on $\mu$ is estimated by fixing the corresponding nuisance parameter at  $\rm{\theta_{0}} \pm \Delta\theta$,
%where $\rm{\theta_{0}}$ is the nominal value of the nuisance parameter and $\Delta\theta$ is its pre-fit uncertainty, and performing 
%the fit again. 
%The difference between the default and modified $\mu$, $\Delta\mu$, represents the effect of the systematic uncertainty in question on $\mu$.
%The same procedure is followed to estimate the post-fit impact on $\mu$,  but the corresponding nuisance parameter is instead fixed 
%at  $\hat\mathrm{{\theta}} \pm \sigma_\mathrm{{\theta}}$,  where $\hat\mathrm{{\theta}}$ is the fitted value of the nuisance parameter and 
%$\sigma_\mathrm{{\theta}}$ is its post-fit uncertainty.
%For reference, $\Delta\mu=0.05$ corresponds to $\Delta\BR(t \to Hc)\simeq 0.05\%$.
%
%Prior to the fit, the systematic uncertainties with the largest impact on $\mu$ are
%the leading uncertainty for light-jet tagging and the uncertainty on the $\ttbar$ background associated with the choice of
%parton shower and hadronisation models. The significant impact from light-jet tagging results from 
%the large fraction of $\ttbar$+light-jets background present in the (4 j, 4 b) channel, which peaks at high values of the 
%final discriminant, like the signal, and thus cannot be strongly constrained by the fit. 
%Because of this, this uncertainty remains the leading one after the fit. 
%In contrast, the uncertainty related to  $\ttbar$ modelling is significantly constrained by the fit since it has a large
%impact ($\sim$5--16\%) on the $\ttbar$+light-jets background normalisation in the highly populated channels with two $b$-tags. 
%As a result, this uncertainty is ranked only fourth in importance after the fit, becoming comparable to uncertainties 
%such as the choice of renormalisation scale for $\ttbb$, the leading uncertainty for $c$-jet tagging and the $\ttcc$ normalisation.
%Of these, the nuisance parameter associated with the choice of the renormalisation scale for $\ttbb$ 
%is slightly pulled (by half of the prior uncertainty) to improve agreement with the data in the (4 j, 4 b) and (5 j, 4 b) channels. 
%In these channels, this uncertainty causes variations of up to $\sim$5\% in the bin contents in some regions of the final discriminant, 
%i.e. distorting its shape compared to that of the nominal prediction, but the sensitivity is not sufficient to constrain it significantly.
%The leading uncertainty from $c$-tagging causes small (few percent) distortions in the shape of the background, and also 
%cannot be constrained by the fit. In contrast, the fit is sensitive to the $\ttcc$ normalisation and the second-leading uncertainty 
%for $c$-tagging,\footnote{The main effect of this uncertainty is a change in normalisation for the background with almost no effect on its shape
%in the final discriminant.} through the comparison of data 
%and predictions across channels with different $b$-tag multiplicity, yielding results in agreement with the nominal predictions
%but with half the initial uncertainties. 
%
%Other nuisance parameters have a smaller impact on the signal extraction and typically have small pulls or constraints.
%One exception is the nuisance parameter associated with the $\ttbar$ cross section, which affects the signal extraction indirectly 
%through the existing small fraction of non-$\ttbar$ background,
%and after the fit is found to be consistent with the nominal prediction but is constrained owing to the large 
%number of $\ttbar$ events. On the other hand, a slight pull is obtained for the nuisance parameter associated with one of the uncertainties
%for the top quark $\pt$ and $\ttbar$ system $\pt$ reweightings, which is used by the fit to improve agreement between data and prediction 
%in the channels with two $b$-tags but which has very small effect on the background prediction in the signal region.

\subsection{$\Htautau$ search}
\label{sec:results_Htautau}

A binned likelihood fit under the signal-plus-background hypothesis is performed to the BDT discriminant distributions in the four 
analysis regions considered (see Section~\ref{sec:strategy_Htautau}). The unconstrained parameters of the fit are the signal 
strength, as well as four independent parameters associated with the normalisation of the fake $\tauhad$ background in each of the analysis regions. 
Figure~\ref{fig:prepostfit_unblinded_WbHc_lh} shows a comparison of the data and prediction in the BDT discriminant distribution for 3j and $\geq$4j regions 
in the $\lephad$ channel, both pre- and post-fit to data, in the case of the $\Hc$ search.  
A similar comparison for the 3j and $\geq$4j regions in the $\hadhad$ channel can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:prepostfit_unblinded_WbHc_hh}.
The post-fit yields can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:prepostfit_yields_Htautau_appendix}.
The best-fit branching ratio obtained is $\BR(t\to Hc)=[-0.06^{+0.12}_{-0.10}\,(\mathrm{stat+syst})]\%$, assuming that $\BR(t\to Hu)=0$. 
A similar fit is performed for the $\Hu$ search, yielding $\BR(t\to Hu)=[-0.06^{+0.10}_{-0.09}\,(\mathrm{stat+syst})]\%$,
assuming that $\BR(t\to Hc)=0$. In both cases, the uncertainty in the measured branching ratio is dominated by the statistical uncertainty.
The main contributions to the total systematic uncertainty arise from the fake $\tauhad$ background estimation and the uncertainty associated
with the different response of the detector the quark-initiated and gluon-initiated jets.
No significant excess in data above the background expectation is found, 
and observed (expected) 95\% CL limits are set on $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)$:
$\BR(t\to Hc)<0.22\%\,(0.24\%)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)<0.19\%\,(0.22\%)$.

\subsection{Combination of ATLAS searches}
\label{sec:results_combo}

The $\Hbb$ and $\Htautau$ searches discussed previously are combined with ATLAS searches in 
diphoton~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd} and multilepton~\cite{Aaboud:2018pob} final states using the same data set. 
In this combination, the only systematic uncertainties taken to be fully correlated among the four searches are 
those affecting the integrated luminosity, the $\ttbar$ cross section, signal modelling, and a subset of jet-related uncertainties 
(jet energy resolution and JVT requirement). 
\textbf{What about the uncertainties on the Higgs BRs?}
%The uncertainties on the Higgs boson branching ratios primarily affect the $\Hgg$ and $\Hbb$ searches.  
Other uncertainties such as those associated with leptons,
jet energy scale and $b$-tagging should be partially correlated among the searches, but the differences in treatment 
between analyses (different lepton selection and $\pt$ cuts, different uncertainty breakdown for jet energy scale and 
different $b$-tagging efficiency working points are used) make it difficult to account for correlations. However, since all searches, 
with the exception of the $\Hbb$ search, are dominated by the data statistics, the effect of this simplification is negligible.

The first set of combined results is obtained for each branching ratio separately, setting the other branching ratio to zero.
The best-fit combined branching ratios are $\BR(t\to Hc)=[0.XX \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ stat.}) \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ syst.})]\%$ and 
$\BR(t\to Hu)=[0.XX \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ stat.}) \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ syst.})]\%$.  
%The difference between the central values of $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)$ originates from the ability of the $H \to b\bar{b}$ search to 
%probe both decay modes separately.
A comparison of the best-fit branching ratios for the individual searches and their combination can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:summary_printnum_hc} 
for $\BR(t\to Hc)$ and Figure~\ref{fig:summary_printnum_hu} for $\BR(t\to Hu)$.
The observed (expected) 95\% CL combined upper limits on the branching ratios are 
$\BR(t\to Hc)<0.XX\%\,(0.08\%)$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)<0.XX\%\,(0.08\%)$. 

The corresponding observed (expected) upper limits on the couplings are $|\lamHc|<0.XX\,(0.XX)$ and $|\lamHu|<0.XX\,(0.XX)$.
A summary of the upper limits on the branching ratios obtained by the individual searches, as well as their combination, 
can be found in Table~\ref{tab:limits_summary}, as is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:limits_combo_1D}.

A similar set of results can be obtained by  simultaneously probing both branching ratios. Since each of the searches has
slightly different sensitivity to the two branching ratios, a simultaneous fit is performed for the combination of all searches.
The best-fit branching ratios obtained from the simultaneous fit are 
$\BR(t\to Hc)=[0.XX \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ stat.}) \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ syst.})]\%$ and 
$\BR(t\to Hu)=[0.XX \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ stat.}) \pm 0.XX\,(\mathrm{ syst.})]\%$, with a correlation coefficient of $-0.XX$, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nllscan_combo_2D}.
Figure~\ref{fig:limits_combo_2D}(a) shows the 95\% CL upper limits on the branching ratios in the $\BR(t\to Hu)$ versus $\BR(t\to Hc)$ plane. 
The corresponding upper limits on the couplings in the $|\lamHu|$ versus $|\lamHc|$ plane can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:limits_combo_2D}(b).
