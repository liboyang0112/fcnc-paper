\section{Data sample and event preselection}
\label{sec:data_presel}

Both searches are based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ with 25 ns bunch spacing collected 
with the ATLAS detector in 2015 and 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $36.1~\ifb$.
Only events recorded with a single-electron trigger, a single-muon trigger, or a ditau trigger under stable beam conditions 
and for which all detector subsystems were operational are considered.
The number of $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing in this dataset ranges from about 8 to 45 interactions, with an average of 24.
%The mean number of $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing in the dataset is 24.

Single-electron and single-muon triggers with low $\pt$ threshold and lepton isolation requirements are combined in a logical OR 
with higher-threshold triggers without isolation requirements to ensure maximum efficiency. 
For muon triggers, the lowest $\pt$ threshold is 20 (26)~\gev\ in 2015 (2016), while the higher $\pt$ threshold is 50~\gev\ in both years. 
For electrons, triggers with a $\pt$ threshold of 24 (26)~\gev\ in 2015 (2016) and isolation requirements are used
along with triggers with a 60~\gev\ threshold and no isolation requirements, and with a 120 (140)~\gev\ threshold 
with looser identification criteria and no isolation requirements.
%For ditau triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\tauhad$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev\ with the medium identification required.
For ditau triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\tauhad$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev.
In both searches, events satisfying the trigger selection are required to have at least one primary vertex candidate.

Events selected by the $\Hbb$ search are recorded with a single-electron or single-muon trigger and 
are required to have exactly one electron or muon that matches, with $\Delta R < 0.15$, the lepton triggering the event.  
Furthermore, at least four jets are required, of which at least two must be $b$-tagged.

In the $\Htautau$ search, events are classified into $\lephad$ and $\hadhad$ channels depending on the 
multiplicity of selected leptons. Events in the $\lephad$ channel are recorded with a single-electron or single-muon trigger 
and are required to have exactly one selected electron or muon and at least one $\tauhad$ candidate. 
The selected charged light lepton is required to match, with $\Delta R < 0.15$, the lepton triggering the event and to have a $\pt$ exceeding the trigger $\pt$ threshold by 1~\gev\ or 2~\gev\ (depending on the lepton trigger and 
data taking conditions). In addition, its electric charge is required to be of opposite sign to that of the leading $\tauhad$ candidate.
Events in the $\hadhad$ channel are recorded with a ditau trigger, and are required to have at least two $\tauhad$ candidates and 
no selected charged light leptons. The two leading $\tauhad$ candidates are required to have a charge of opposite sign. 
In addition, in both ditau channels, trigger matching for $\tauhad$ candidates, at least three jets and exactly one $b$-tagged jet are required.

The above requirements apply to the physics objects as defined in Section~\ref{sec:objects}.
%, which are in general different between both searches. 
These requirements, which ensure a negligible overlap between the $\Hbb$ and $\Htautau$ searches,
are referred to as the ``preselection'' and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:preselection}.
