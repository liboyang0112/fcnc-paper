\section{Data sample and event preselection}
\label{sec:data_presel}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ with 25 ns bunch spacing collected from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139~\ifb$.
Only events recorded with a single-electron trigger, a single-muon trigger, or a di-$\tau$ trigger under stable beam conditions 
and for which all detector subsystems were operational are considered for analysis. While the events recorded by di-lepton triggers fall into the control regions used for fake-tau background estimation.
The number of $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing in this dataset ranges from about 8 to 45, with an average of 24.

Single-electron and single-muon triggers with low $\pt$ thresholds and lepton isolation requirements are combined in a logical OR 
with higher-threshold triggers but with a looser identification criterion and without any isolation requirement.
The lowest $\pt$ threshold used for muons is 20 (26)~\gev\ in 2015 (2016-2018), while for electrons the threshold is 24 (26)~\gev.
%For ditau triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\tauhad$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev\ with the medium identification required.
For di-$\tau$ triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\had$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev.
Events satisfying the trigger selection are required to have at least one primary vertex candidate.

The signal final state including an electron or muon or $\lep$ are referred to as leptonic channel, otherwise hadronic channel.

The events in the leptonic channel are recorded by single-electron or single-muon trigger, required to have exactly one electron or muon that matches, with $\Delta R < 0.15$, the lepton reconstructed by the trigger. Further requirements are defined targeting different signal decay modes:  
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_h\lephad$: Targeting $t_hH$ and $t_ht(qH)$ with $H\to\lephad$ decay. Exactly one $\had$ with opposite-side charge to $\tau_l$ is required, including at least three jets with exactly one $b$-tagged jet.
\item $t_l\hadhad$: Targeting $t_lH$ and $t_lt(qH)$ with $H\to\hadhad$ decay. Exactly one lepton and two opposite-sign $\had$ are selected, including at least 1 jet with exactly one $b$-tagged jet.
\item $t_l\had$: Also targeting $t_lH$ and $t_lt(qH)$ with $H\to\hadhad$ decay when one of the $\had$ fails the tau reconstruction or identification so that there is only
  one $\had$ candidate reconstructed. Exactly one $\had$ with same-sign charge to the lepton is required, including at least 2 jets with exactly one $b$-tagged jet.
\end{itemize}

The events in the hadronic channel are recorded by di-tau trigger, required to have both leading and trailing $\had$ passed the trigger. Further requirements are defined targeting signal decay modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item $t_h\hadhad$: Targeting $t_hH$ and $t_ht(qH)$ with $H\to\hadhad$ decay. Exactly two $\had$ with opposite-sign charge are selected, including at least 3 jet with exactly one $b$-tagged jet.
\end{itemize}

The above requirements apply to the reconstructed objects defined in Section~\ref{sec:objects}.
%, which are in general different between both searches. 
These requirements are referred to as the preselection and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:preselection}.
