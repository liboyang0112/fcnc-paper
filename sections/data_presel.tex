\section{Data sample and event preselection}
\label{sec:data_presel}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ with 25 ns bunch spacing collected from 2015 to 2018, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $139.6~\ifb$.
Only events recorded with a single-electron trigger, a single-muon trigger, or a di-$\tau$ trigger under stable beam conditions 
and for which all detector subsystems were operational are considered for signal regions. While the events recorded by di-lepton triggers fall into the control regions used for fake-tau background estimation.
The number of $pp$ interactions per bunch crossing in this dataset ranges from about 8 to 45, with an average of 24.

Single-electron and single-muon triggers with low $\pt$ thresholds and lepton isolation requirements are combined in a logical OR 
with higher-threshold triggers but with a looser identification criterion and without any isolation requirement.
The lowest $\pt$ threshold used for muons is 20 (26)~\gev\ in 2015 (2016-2018), while for electrons the threshold is 24 (26)~\gev.
%For ditau triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\tauhad$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev\ with the medium identification required.
For di-$\tau$ triggers, the $\pt$ threshold of the leading (trailing) $\had$ candidate is 35 (25)~\gev.
Events satisfying the trigger selection are required to have at least one primary vertex candidate.

The signal final state including an electron or muon or \lep are referred to as leptonic channel, otherwise hadronic channel.

The events in the leptonic channel are recorded by single-electron or single-muon trigger, required to have exactly one electron or muon that matches, with $\Delta R < 0.15$, the lepton reconstructed by the trigger. Further requirement are defined targeting different signal decay mode:  
\begin{itemize}
	\item $t_h\lephad$: Targeting $t(q)H\to bqq(q)\lephad$ decay mode. Exactly one additional $\had$ with charge opposite to the lepton is further required. At least 3 jets with exactly one $b$-tagged are required.
	\item $t_l\hadhad$: Targeting $t(q)H\to bl\nu(q)\hadhad$ decay mode. At least two additional $\had$ with opposite charge are further required. At least 1 jet with exactly one $b$-tagged is required.
	\item $t_l\had$: Targeting $t(q)H\to bl\nu(q)\hadhad$ decay mode when one of the \had fails the tau reconstruction or identificaiton so that there is only one reconstructed \had candidate. Exactly one additional $\had$ with charge same for the lepton is further required. At least 2 jets with exactly one $b$-tagged are required.
\end{itemize}

The events in the hadronic channel are recorded by di-tau trigger, required to have both leading and trailing $\had$ matched to the $\had$'s reconstructed by the trigger. No selected electrons or muons is required. The two \had candidates are required to have charges of opposite sign. 

The above requirements apply to the reconstructed objects defined in Section~\ref{sec:objects}.
%, which are in general different between both searches. 
These requirements are referred to as the preselection and are summarised in Table~\ref{tab:preselection}.
