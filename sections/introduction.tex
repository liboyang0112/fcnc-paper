\section{Introduction}

After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS~\cite{Aad:2012tfa} and 
CMS~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa} collaborations, 
%Since the observation of Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} at
a comprehensive programme of measurements % of its properties
has been conducted to explore this new particle. Measurements so far proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. 
However, the program is ongoing and precision measurements as well as searches for rare new physics processes beyond the Standard Model (BSM)
are underway. One such possibility is flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions between the Higgs boson, 
the top quark, and an up-type quark, $tqH$ ($q=u, c$), which has been actively searched for by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations.  
%with increased precision and proved to be consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. 
%for nearly a decade, by which no significant sign of deviation from Standard Model (SM) was observed until today.
%However the LHC still provides an excellent opportunity to search for rare new physics processes beyond the Standard Model (BSM).  
%there are still chances to find new physics by improving the sensitivity of previous searches.
%The flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions 
%between the Higgs boson, the top quark, and a $u$- or $c$-quark, $tqH$ ($q=u,c$) has been actively searched for by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. %is still an active topic.
Since the Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark~\cite{Aad:2015zhl},
%with a measured mass $m_H=125.09 \pm 0.24~\gev$~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}, 
such interactions could manifest themselves as FCNC top-quark decays~($t\to qH$)~\cite{Agashe:2013hma}.
%Furthermore, if the $tqH$ interaction exists, the associated single-top and  Higgs  production process through this interaction would enhance 
%becomes non-zero, enhancing 
%the total
%production cross section of $pp\rightarrow tH$.

In the Standard Model (SM), the FCNC interaction is forbidden at tree level and suppressed at higher orders due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}. Therefore, an observation of an enhanced rate of this decay would be a clear evidence for new physics.
Furthermore, if the $tqH$ interaction exists, the associated single-top and  Higgs  production process through this interaction would enhance
%becomes non-zero, enhancing
the total production cross section of $pp\rightarrow tH$.
The $t\to qH$ branching fraction in the SM is calculated to be exceedingly small, $\BR(t\to qH)\approx10^{-15}$~\cite{Eilam:1990zc,Mele:1998ag,AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,Zhang:2013xya}. 
%such decays are suppressed relative to the dominant $t\to Wb$ decay mode, since $tqH$ 
%interactions are forbidden at the tree level and suppressed even at higher orders in the perturbative expansion due to the 
%Glashow--Iliopoulos--Maiani (GIM) mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}.
%As a result, the SM predictions for the $t \to Hq$ branching 
%ratios ($\BR$) are exceedingly small, $\BR(t\to Hu) \sim 10^{-17} $ and $\BR(t\to Hc) \sim 10^{-15}$~\cite{Eilam:1990zc,Mele:1998ag,AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,Zhang:2013xya}, making them undetectable in the foreseeable future.
However, these branching ratios can be as high as $\BR(t\to qH) \sim 10^{-5}$ if considering beyond the SM processes. Examples of these include: quark-singlet models~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2002kr}, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)~\cite{ Branco:2hdm2012} with or without flavour violation,
 %of type I, with explicit flavour conservation,
 %and of type II, such as
the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM)~\cite{Bejar:2000ub, Guasch:1999jp,Cao:2007dk,Cao:2014udj},
supersymmetric models with R-parity violation~\cite{Eilam:2001dh}, composite Higgs models with partial  compositeness~\cite{Azatov:2014lha}, 
or warped extra dimensions models with SM fermions in the bulk~\cite{Azatov:2009na}. 
% In contrast, large enhancements of these branching ratios are possible in some scenarios beyond the SM.
% Examples include quark-singlet models~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2002kr}, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM)~\cite{ %Branco:2hdm2012} with or without flavour violation,
% %of type I, with explicit flavour conservation,
% %and of type II, such as
% the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM)~\cite{Bejar:2000ub, Guasch:1999jp,Cao:2007dk,Cao:2014udj},
% supersymmetric models with R-parity violation~\cite{Eilam:2001dh}, composite Higgs models with partial  %compositeness~\cite{Azatov:2014lha}, 
% or warped extra dimensions models with SM fermions in the bulk~\cite{Azatov:2009na}. 
% In these scenarios, branching ratios can be as high as $\BR(t\to qH) \sim 10^{-5}$. 
An even larger branching ratio of  $\BR(t\to cH) \sim 10^{-3}$ can be reached in 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation, since a tree-level FCNC coupling is no longer forbidden by any symmetry~\cite{Cheng:1987rs,Baum:2008qm,Chen:2013qta,Chiang:2015cba,Crivellin:2015hha,Botella:2015hoa, Gori:2017tvg,Chiang:2017fjr}. 
%While other FCNC top couplings ($tq\gamma$, $tqZ$, $tqg$) are also enhanced in these scenarios beyond the SM, 
%the largest enhancements are typically found for the $tqH$ couplings, and in particular the $tcH$ coupling~\cite{Agashe:2013hma}.
%Therefore, an observation of an enhanced rate of this decay would be a clear evidence for new physics.
%The $tqH$ interaction could also potentially open up more
%Higgs decay channels, such as $H\rightarrow t^*q\rightarrow Wbq$, but they are likely suppressed due to the $t-H$ mass difference,
%which could be interesting for future studies.
%Furthermore, if the $tqH$ interaction exists, the associated single-top and  Higgs  production process through %this interaction would enhance 
%%becomes non-zero, enhancing 
%the total
%production cross section of $pp\rightarrow tH$.
The study of $pp\rightarrow tH$ process will therefore also contribute to the FCNC interaction searches~\cite{Greljo:2014dka}.
The $tH$ associated production in the SM is expected to have a cross section of $92^{+7}_{-12}$ fb at centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}= 13~\tev$~\cite{deFlorian:2016spz}.

Searches for $t \to qH$ decays have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, taking advantage of the large samples
of top-quark pair ($\ttbar$) events collected in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7~\tev$ and $8~\tev$~\cite{Aad:2014dya,Aad:2015pja,Khachatryan:2016atv} during Run~1 of the LHC, as well as at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$~\cite{fcnc36} using early Run~2 data.
In these searches, one of the top quarks is required to decay into $Wb$, while the other top quark decays into $qH$ with a small branching ratio 
 $\BR(t\to qH)$, denoted as $\ttbar \to WbHq$\footnote{In the following, $WbHq$ is used to denote both $W^+b H\bar{q}$ and its charge conjugate, $HqW^- \bar{b}$. Similarly, 
$WbWb$ is used to denote $W^+b W^- \bar{b}$.}.  The Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of $m_H=125~\gev$ and to decay as predicted by
the SM.
%The assumption of using SM-like Higgs boson branching ratios is motivated by the fact that measurements of the flavour-diagonal Higgs boson couplings by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are in agreement with the SM prediction within about 10\%~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Sirunyan:2018koj}. 
%Furthermore, typical beyond-the-SM scenarios that predict significant enhancements to $\BR(t\to Hq)$, also predict modifications to the Higgs boson branching ratios at the few percent level or below, well beyond the current experimental precision.
%Some of the most sensitive single-channel searches have been performed in the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, which
%has a small branching ratio of $\BR(H\to \gamma\gamma)\simeq 0.2\%$, but benefits from having a very small background contamination 
%and excellent diphoton mass re\-so\-lu\-tion. 
%Searches targeting signatures with two same-charge leptons or three leptons (electrons or muons), generically referred to as multileptons,
%are able to exploit a branching ratio that is significantly larger for the $H \rightarrow WW^*, \tau\tau$ decay modes than for the $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay mode,
%are able to exploit a significantly larger branching ratio for the Higgs boson decay into $H \to WW^*, \tau\tau$ compared to the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, 
%and are also characterised by relatively small backgrounds.
%However, in general they do not have good mass resolution,\footnote{An exception is the $H\to ZZ^*\to \ell^+\ell^- \ell^{\prime +}\ell^{\prime -}$ 
%($\ell, \ell^\prime = e, \mu$) decay mode, which has a very small branching ratio and thus is not promising for this search.} 
%so any excess would be hard to interpret as originating from $t \to Hq$ decays.
%Finally, searches have also been performed exploiting the dominant Higgs boson decay mode, $H\to b\bar{b}$, which has a branching ratio 
%of $\BR(H\to b\bar{b})\simeq 58\%$.
Compared to Run~1, the Run~2 searches, summarised in Table~\ref{tab:limits_summary_ref}, benefit from the increased $\ttbar$ cross section at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, as well as the larger integrated luminosity.
Using 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, the ATLAS Collaboration has derived upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) of branching ratio
$\BR(t\to cH)<0.22\%$ using $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decays~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd}, $\BR(t\to cH)<0.16\%$ based on
%signatures with two same-charge light leptons (electrons or muons) or three light leptons 
multilepton (electron or muon) signatures resulting from 
$H \to  WW^*, ZZ^*$, $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ in which both $\tau$-leptons decay leptonically~\cite{Aaboud:2018pob},
$\BR(t\to cH)<0.42\%$ using $H\to b\bar{b}$ decay~\cite{fcnc36}, and of $\BR(t\to cH)<0.19\%$ using $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ decay in which at least
one of $\tau$-leptons decays hadronically~\cite{fcnc36}.  
These upper limits are derived assuming that the branching ratio $\BR(t\to uH)$ is null. Similar upper limits are obtained for $\BR(t\to uH)$ assuming $\BR(t\to cH)=0$.
%The searches with  $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$ decays are later published~\cite{fcnc36}, unfortunately with no FCNC signal found.
Combining all of the ATLAS searches using 36.1~fb$^{-1}$ Run~2 data, upper limits at 95\% CL on the branching fractions are 
set at $\BR(t\to cH)<0.11\%$ assuming $\BR(t\to uH)=0$, and $\BR(t\to uH)<0.12\%$ assuming $\BR(t\to cH)=0$~\cite{fcnc36}.

The CMS Collaboration performed a similar search using  
$H\to b\bar{b}$ decays~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} with 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, resulting 
in upper limits of $\BR(t\to cH)<0.47\%$ and $\BR(t\to uH)<0.47\%$, in each case neglecting the other decay mode.
%Compared with previous searches, 
The search in Ref.~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} considers in addition the contribution to the signal from 
$pp \to tH$ production~\cite{Greljo:2014dka}. 
CMS recently updated their search for $tqH$ in the $H\to b\bar{b}$ channel using
their full Run 2 data and  set observed(expected) upper limits on  $\BR(t\to cH)$ of $9.4\times10^{-4}(8.6\times10^{-4})$
and $\BR{B}(t\to uH)$ of $7.9\times10^{-4}(1.1\times10^{-3})$~\cite{CMS:2021gfa}.
%CMS also recently reported a search for $tqH$ in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ mode using the full Run-2 data and set observed(expected) upper limits on $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hu)$ of $1.9\times10^{-4}(3.1\times10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hc)$ of $7.3\times10^{-4}(5.1\times10^{-4})$~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-20-007}.

%Upper limits on the branching ratios $\BR(t\to Hq)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated to upper limits on the non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings $\lamHq$ 
%appearing in the following Lagrangian~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}:
%\begin{equation}
%{\cal L}_{\rm FCNC} = -\lambda_{t_L q_R} \bar{t}_L q_R H - \lambda_{q_L t_R} \bar{q}_L t_R H  + h.c.
%\end{equation}
%The branching ratio $\BR(t\to Hq)$ is estimated as the ratio of its partial width~\cite{Zhang:2013xya} to the SM $t \to Wb$ partial width~\cite{Denner:1990ns}, 
%which is assumed to be dominant. Both predicted partial widths include next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections.
%Using the expression derived in Sect. 1.2 of Ref.~\cite{ATL-COM-PHYS-2016-1664}, the coupling $|\lamHq|$ can be extracted as $| \lamHq | = (1.92 \pm 0.02) \sqrt{\BR(t\to Hq)}$.
%The $\lamHq$ coupling corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the couplings relative to the two possible chirality combinations of the quark fields, 
%$\lamHq \equiv \sqrt{ |\lambda_{t_Lq_R}|^2 +   |\lambda_{q_L t_R}|^2 }$~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}.

%This paper is focused on the decay mode of the Higgs boson into
$\tau$-leptons with the complete Run~2 dataset collected in 2015-2018. The corresponding integrated luminosity is 139 fb$^{-1}$. Both $\ttbar \to WbHq$ decay and $pp \to tH$ production are targeted. The dataset is divided into several final states depending on the production mode and
the  $W$ and tau decays. Top quark pair production events where the $W$ boson decays hadronically (leptonically) are referred to as $t_h$ ($t_{\ell}$).
The decays $\tau \to \ell \nu_{\ell} \nu_{\tau}$ are referred as $\lep$, while the decays $\tau \to hadrons \nu_{\tau}$ are referred as $\thad$.
The contribution of 
$W\rightarrow\tau\nu$ is included as $\lep$ in $t_{\ell}$ when the $\tau$ decays into a light lepton (electron or muon) or as $\thad$ 
in $t_h$ when the $\tau$ decays hadronically.
%either hadronically or leptonically from the $t\rightarrow Wb$ decay, which are referred as $t_h$ and $t_l$. The contribution of $W\rightarrow\tau\nu$ is included either in
%$t_l$ when the $\tau$ decays into a light lepton (electron or muon) as $\tau_{\text{lep}}$ or in $t_h$ when the $\tau$ decays hadronically as $\thad$.
The $H\rightarrow \tau\tau$ decay is detected in
either $\tlhad$ or $\thadhad$ final states when the top decays hadronically ($t_h$), but only in $\thadhad$ final state when the top decay leptonically ($t_{\ell}$) in order to avoid overlap with
multilepton analysis~\cite{Aaboud:2018pob}. 
Events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-leptons without electron or muon are named hadronic channels. Events with at least one \tauhad with an additional electron or muon are named leptonic channels. More signal regions (with top quark decay leptonically) are exploited here compared to the previous FCNC $\Htautau$ search conducted using partial Run~2 data~\cite{fcnc36}.
In addition, an improved treatment of misidentified $\tau$-leptons in simulation and data-driven
fake estimations from multi-jet background are implemented.
% and more
%$$t\bar{t}$ control regions (CRtt) are used for calibration of misidentified (fake) taus in Monte Carlo and data-driven fake estimations from QCD multi-jet background.
Finally, a multivariate technique based on boosted decision trees, is used to discriminate between the signal and the background on the basis of their different kinematics distributions. 

%The expected sensitivity is about a factor of two relative to the most sensitive results~\cite{fcnc36} up until now.
