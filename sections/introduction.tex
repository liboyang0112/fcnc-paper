Since the observation of Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments~\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a comprehensive programme of measurements of its properties have been conducted for nearly a decade, by which no significant sign of deviation from Standard Model (SM) was observed until today. However there is still chance finding new physics with searches already attempted but with improved sensitivities. The presence of flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) interactions 
between the Higgs boson, the top quark, and a $u$- or $c$-quark, $tqH$ ($q=u,c$) is still an active topic. Since the Higgs boson is lighter than the top quark~\cite{Aad:2015zhl},
%with a measured mass $m_H=125.09 \pm 0.24~\gev$~\cite{Aad:2015zhl}, 
such interactions would manifest themselves as FCNC top-quark decays~\cite{Agashe:2013hma}, $t\to H q$.  
In the Standard Model (SM), such decays are suppressed relative to the dominant $t\to Wb$ decay mode, since $tqH$ 
interactions are forbidden at the tree level and suppressed even at higher orders in the perturbative expansion due to the 
Glashow--Iliopoulos--Maiani (GIM) mechanism~\cite{Glashow:1970gm}.  As a result, the SM predictions for the $t \to Hq$ branching 
ratios ($\BR$) are exceedingly small, $\BR(t\to Hu) \sim 10^{-17} $ and $\BR(t\to Hc) \sim 10^{-15}$~\cite{Eilam:1990zc,Mele:1998ag,AguilarSaavedra:2004wm,Zhang:2013xya}, making them undetectable in the foreseeable future.
In contrast, large enhancements of these branching ratios are possible in some scenarios beyond the SM.
Examples include quark-singlet models~\cite{AguilarSaavedra:2002kr}, two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) of type I, with explicit flavour conservation,
and of type II, such as the minimal supersymmetric SM (MSSM)~\cite{Bejar:2000ub, Guasch:1999jp,Cao:2007dk,Cao:2014udj}, supersymmetric models
with R-parity violation~\cite{Eilam:2001dh}, composite Higgs models with partial compositeness~\cite{Azatov:2014lha}, 
or warped extra dimensions models with SM fermions in the bulk~\cite{Azatov:2009na}. 
In these scenarios, branching ratios can be as high as $\BR(t\to Hq) \sim 10^{-5}$. 
An even larger branching ratio of  $\BR(t\to Hc) \sim 10^{-3}$ can be reached in 2HDM without explicit flavour conservation (type III),
since a tree-level FCNC coupling is not forbidden by any symmetry~\cite{Cheng:1987rs,Baum:2008qm,Chen:2013qta,Chiang:2015cba,Crivellin:2015hha,Botella:2015hoa, Gori:2017tvg,Chiang:2017fjr}. 
While other FCNC top couplings ($tq\gamma$, $tqZ$, $tqg$) are also enhanced in these scenarios beyond the SM, 
the largest enhancements are typically found for the $tqH$ couplings, and in particular the $tcH$ coupling~\cite{Agashe:2013hma}.

Searches for $t \to Hq$ decays have been performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations, taking advantage of the large samples
of top-quark pair ($\ttbar$) events collected in proton-proton ($pp$) collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\sqrt{s}=7~\tev$ and $8~\tev$~\cite{Aad:2014dya,Aad:2015pja,Khachatryan:2016atv} during Run~1 of the LHC, as well as at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$~\cite{fcnc36} using early Run~2 data.
In these searches, one of the top quarks is required to decay into $Wb$, while the other top quark decays into $Hq$, yielding $\ttbar \to WbHq$.\footnote{ 
In the following, $WbHq$ is used to denote both $W^+b H\bar{q}$ and its charge conjugate, $HqW^- \bar{b}$. Similarly, 
$WbWb$ is used to denote $W^+b W^- \bar{b}$.}  The Higgs boson is assumed to have a mass of $m_H=125~\gev$ and to decay as predicted by
the SM. The simplifying assumption of SM-like Higgs boson branching ratios is motivated by the fact that measurements of the flavour-diagonal Higgs boson couplings by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations are in agreement with the SM prediction within about 10\%~\cite{Khachatryan:2016vau,Sirunyan:2018koj}. 
Furthermore, typical beyond-the-SM scenarios that predict significant enhancements to $\BR(t\to Hq)$, also predict modifications to the Higgs boson branching ratios at the few percent level or below, well beyond the current experimental precision.
Some of the most sensitive single-channel searches have been performed in the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, which
has a small branching ratio of $\BR(H\to \gamma\gamma)\simeq 0.2\%$, but benefits from having a very small background contamination 
and excellent diphoton mass re\-so\-lu\-tion. 
Searches targeting signatures with two same-charge leptons or three leptons (electrons or muons), generically referred to as multileptons,
are able to exploit a branching ratio that is significantly larger for the $H \rightarrow WW^*, \tau\tau$ decay modes than for the $H \rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ decay mode,
%are able to exploit a significantly larger branching ratio for the Higgs boson decay into $H \to WW^*, \tau\tau$ compared to the $H\to\gamma\gamma$ decay mode, 
and are also characterised by relatively small backgrounds.
%However, in general they do not have good mass resolution,\footnote{An exception is the $H\to ZZ^*\to \ell^+\ell^- \ell^{\prime +}\ell^{\prime -}$ 
%($\ell, \ell^\prime = e, \mu$) decay mode, which has a very small branching ratio and thus is not promising for this search.} 
%so any excess would be hard to interpret as originating from $t \to Hq$ decays.
Finally, searches have also been performed exploiting the dominant Higgs boson decay mode, $H\to b\bar{b}$, which has a branching ratio 
of $\BR(H\to b\bar{b})\simeq 58\%$. Compared with Run~1, the Run~2 searches benefit from the increased $\ttbar$ cross section at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, as well as the larger integrated luminosity.
Using 36.1 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, the ATLAS Collaboration has derived upper limits at 95\% confidence level (CL) of  
$\BR(t\to Hc)<0.22\%$ using $H\to \gamma\gamma$ decays~\cite{Aaboud:2017mfd}, and of $\BR(t\to Hc)<0.16\%$ based on
%signatures with two same-charge light leptons (electrons or muons) or three light leptons 
multilepton signatures resulting from 
$H \to WW^*$, $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ in which both $\tau$-leptons decay leptonically, or $H \to ZZ^*$~\cite{Aaboud:2018pob}.
These upper limits are derived assuming that $\BR(t\to Hu)=0$. Similar upper limits are obtained for $\BR(t\to Hu)$ if $\BR(t\to Hc)=0$.
The searches with  $H\to \tau^+\tau^-$ and $H\to b\bar{b}$ decays are later published~\cite{fcnc36}, unfortunately with no FCNC signal found. Combining all of the ATLAS searches using 36fb$^{-1}$ Run~2 data, the limits at 95\% CL are set for  $\BR(t\to Hc)<0.11\%$ and $\BR(t\to Hc)<0.12\%$ respectively assuming the other one is 0.
The CMS Collaboration has performed a search using  
$H\to b\bar{b}$ decays~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} with 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of data at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$, resulting 
in upper limits of $\BR(t\to Hc)<0.47\%$ and $\BR(t\to Hu)<0.47\%$, in each case neglecting the other decay mode.
Compared with previous searches, the search in Ref.~\cite{Sirunyan:2017uae} considers in addition the contribution to the signal from 
$pp \to tH$ production~\cite{Greljo:2014dka}.

%Upper limits on the branching ratios $\BR(t\to Hq)$ ($q=u,c$) can be translated to upper limits on the non-flavour-diagonal Yukawa couplings $\lamHq$ 
%appearing in the following Lagrangian~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}:
%\begin{equation}
%{\cal L}_{\rm FCNC} = -\lambda_{t_L q_R} \bar{t}_L q_R H - \lambda_{q_L t_R} \bar{q}_L t_R H  + h.c.
%\end{equation}
%The branching ratio $\BR(t\to Hq)$ is estimated as the ratio of its partial width~\cite{Zhang:2013xya} to the SM $t \to Wb$ partial width~\cite{Denner:1990ns}, 
%which is assumed to be dominant. Both predicted partial widths include next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections.
%Using the expression derived in Sect. 1.2 of Ref.~\cite{ATL-COM-PHYS-2016-1664}, the coupling $|\lamHq|$ can be extracted as $| \lamHq | = (1.92 \pm 0.02) \sqrt{\BR(t\to Hq)}$.
%The $\lamHq$ coupling corresponds to the sum in quadrature of the couplings relative to the two possible chirality combinations of the quark fields, 
%$\lamHq \equiv \sqrt{ |\lambda_{t_Lq_R}|^2 +   |\lambda_{q_L t_R}|^2 }$~\cite{Harnik:2012pb}.

%The searches presented in this paper are focused on the dominant fermionic decay modes of the Higgs boson.
This paper is focused on the tau decay mode of the Higgs boson with the complete dataset collected during the Run~2 from 2016 to 2018. The corresponding integrated luminosity is 139.6 fb$^{-1}$. Both $\ttbar \to WbHq$ decay and $pp \to tH$ production are targeted and the signals are divided into several final states depending on the production modes and the
decay of $W$ boson hadronically and leptonically from the $t\rightarrow Wb$ decay, referred as $t_h$ and $t_l$ respectively. The $H\rightarrow \tau\tau$ decay detected to be in
either $\tlhad$ or $\thadhad$ final states when the top decays hadronically ($t_h$) and only in $\thadhad$ when the top decay leptonically ($t_l$). 
Events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidate (\tauhad) without electron or muon are selected for hadronic channel. Events with at least one \tauhad with an additional electron or muon are selected from leptonic channel. More regions are exploited compared to the FCNC $\Htautau$ search conducted using early Run~2 data amounting to 36fb$^{-1}$.
The analysis also uses various $t\bar{t}$ control regions (CRtt) for calibration of tau fakes in Monte Carlo as well as
data-driven fake estimations from QCD multi-jet background.

Multivariate technique is used to discriminate between the signal and the background on the basis of their different kinematics. 

The expected sensitivity is about a factor of two relative to the most sensitive results~\cite{fcnc36} up until now.
