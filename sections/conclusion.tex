A search for flavour-changing neutral current decays of a top quark into an up-type quark ($q=u, c$) and the Standard Model Higgs boson, $t\to Hq$, is presented. 
The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ recorded in 2015 and 2016 with the ATLAS detector at the 
CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb$^{-1}$.
Two analyses are performed searching for $\ttbar \to WbHq$ production, and targeting the $H \to b\bar{b}$ and $H \to \tau^+\tau^-$ decay modes, respectively.  
The $\Hbb$ search selects events with one isolated light lepton from the $W \to \ell\nu$ decay, and multiple jets, with several 
of them being identified with high purity as originating from the hadronisation of $b$-quarks. 
The $\Htautau$ search selects events with either one or two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates, as well multiple jets. 
Both searches employ multivariate techniques to discriminate between the signal and the background on the basis of their different kinematics. 
No significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, and observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits are derived.
The combination of these searches with ATLAS searches in diphoton and multilepton final states significantly improves the sensitivity, 
yielding observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits on the $t\to Hc$ and $t\to Hu$ branching ratios of $1.1 \times 10^{-3}$ ($8.3 \times 10^{-4}$) 
and $1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ ($8.3 \times 10^{-4}$) respectively.
The corresponding combined observed (expected) upper limits on the $|\lambda_{tcH}|$ and $|\lambda_{tuH}|$ couplings are 0.064 (0.055) and 0.064 (0.055) respectively. 
%Upper limits in the $t\to Hc$ versus $t\to Hu$ branching ratio plane, as well as best-fit branching ratios, are also reported.
These are the most restrictive direct bounds on $tqH$ ($q=u,c$) interactions measured so far.
