A search for flavour-changing neutral current process involving a top quark, an up-type quark ($q=u, c$), and a SM Higgs boson is presented. FCNC $tqH$ interaction is searched for both in $t\bar{t}$ decay mode, where one top quark decays following SM processes and the other one decays through $t\rightarrow Hq$, and in production mode($pp\rightarrow tH$) with a single top quark produced via FCNC interaction, while the decay according to SM. The search is based on a dataset of $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13~\tev$ recorded with the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$. The search selects events with two hadronically decaying $\tau$-lepton candidates ($\tauhad$) or at least one $\tauhad$ with an additional lepton(e,$\mu$), a b-tagged jet as well as multiple jets.Multivariate techniques based on BDT are used to distinguish the signal from the background on the basis of their different kinematics.


Although no significant excess of events above the background expectation is found, about a factor of 2 improvement to 95\% CL upper limits on the $t\to Hq$ branching ratios are reported in Tab~\ref{tab:limits_summary}, along with the Wilson coefficients with respect to the previous partial run-2 results~\cite{Aaboud2019SearchFT}.
Observed (expected) 95\% CL upper limits are set on the $t\to Hc$ and $t\to Hu$ branching ratios of $9.9\times10^{-4}$ ($5.0^{+2.2}_{-1.4}\times10^{-4}$) and $7.2\times10^{-4}$ ($3.6^{+1.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-4}$). The observed (expected) upper limits on the D6 Wilson coefficients from the combination of the searches are $C_{c\phi}<1.38\,(0.97)$ and $C_{u\phi}<1.18\,(0.83)$, respectively.
