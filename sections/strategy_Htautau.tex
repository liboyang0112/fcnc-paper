\section{Strategy for the $\Htautau$ search}
\label{sec:strategy_Htautau}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The analysis strategy adopted in the $\Htautau$ search closely follows that developed in Ref.~\cite{Chen:2015nta} and is summarised in this section.

\subsection{Event categorisation and kinematic reconstruction}
\label{sec:htautau_reco_cat}

In the $\Htautau$ search, the $\ttbar \to WbHq$ signal being probed is characterised by the presence of $\tau$-leptons from the decay of 
the Higgs boson and at least four jets, only one of which originates from a $b$-quark.
If one of the $\tau$-leptons decays leptonically, an isolated electron or muon and significant $\met$ is also expected.
However, in a significant fraction of the events the lowest-$\pt$ jet from the $W$ boson decay fails the minimum $\pt$ requirement of $30~\gev$,
resulting in signal events with only three jets reconstructed.
In order to optimise the sensitivity of the search, the selected events are categorised into four SRs depending 
on the number of $\taulep$ and $\had$ candidates, and on the number of jets:
($\lephad$, 3j), ($\lephad$, $\geq$4j), ($\hadhad$, 3j), and ($\hadhad$, $\geq$4j). 

This event categorisation is primarily motivated by the different quality of the event kinematic reconstruction, depending on the amount 
of $\met$ in the event (larger in $\lephad$ events compared with $\hadhad$ events), and whether a jet from the hadronic top-quark decay 
is missing or not (events with exactly three jets or at least four jets).
The event kinematic reconstruction is based on the strategy used in Ref.~\cite{Chen:2015nta}, and is summarised below.

Events with exactly three jets that are compatible with having a fully reconstructed hadronically decaying 
top quark ($t \to Wb \to qqb$) are rejected, as the $t \to Hq$ decay cannot be reconstructed due to the missing light-quark jet.
This compatibility is assessed via a likelihood function that depends on the reconstructed mass of the three-jet 
system and the two non-$b$-tagged jets.
For the remaining events, the selected jets are assigned to the different top-quark decay products via a criterion based on 
minimising a sum of angular distances between objects. Finally, the four-momenta of the invisible decay products for each $\tau$-lepton decay 
are estimated by minimising a $\chi^2$ function based on the probability density functions for the angular distance of the visible and invisible
products of the $\tau$-lepton decay, and including Gaussian constraints on the $\tau$-lepton mass, the Higgs boson mass and the
measured $\met$ within their expected resolutions. The resolution on the $\tau$-lepton mass and the Higgs boson mass are taken to be 
$1.8~\gev$ and $20~\gev$, respectively, while the resolution on the measured $\met$ is parameterised as a linear function of 
$\sqrt{\sum E_T}$, with $\sum E_T$ denoting the scalar sum of the $\pt$ of all physics objects contributing to the $\met$ reconstruction~\cite{Aaboud:2018tkc}.
After the $\chi^2$ minimisation, the Higgs boson four-momentum, and hence its invariant mass, as well as the 
four-momentum of the parent top quark, are determined with better resolution. Following the event kinematic reconstruction, several kinematic variables
that discriminate between signal and background are defined. These variables are used in the multivariate analysis discussed in the next section.

Boosted decision trees are used in each SR to improve the separation between signal and background. 
%The separate training exploits differences in event kinematics across SRs.  
%draft 1 version
In the training, only $\ttbar \to W(qq)bH(\tau\tau)q$ signal events are used against the total SM background (including both real and fake $\had$ contributions), 
whereas to obtain the result the contributions from $\ttbar \to W(\ell\nu)bHq$ signal events are also taken into account.

%elsewhere the contributions from $\ttbar \to W(\ell\nu)bHq$ signal events are also taken into account. 

A large set of potential variables were investigated in each SR separately, and only those variables that led to better discrimination
by the BDT were kept. The discrimination of a given variable was quantified by the ``separation" and ``importance" measures provided 
by the TMVA package~\cite{Hocker:2007ht}.
The BDT input variables in each SR are listed in Table~\ref{tab:mva_var} and defined in the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item $m_{\tau\tau}^{\text{fit}}$: the invariant mass of the two $\tau$-lepton candidates after the reconstruction of the neutrinos, indicating the reconstructed Higgs boson mass.
\item $m_{Hq}$: the invariant mass of the reconstructed Higgs boson and the associated light-quark jet in the $t \to Hq$ decay, corresponding to the reconstructed mass of the parent top quark.
\item $m_{\text{T,lep}}$: the transverse mass calculated from the lepton and $\mpt$ in the $\lephad$ channel.
\item $p_{\text{T,1}}$ and $p_{\text{T,2}}$:  the transverse momenta of the lepton and $\had$ candidate (referred to as particles 1 and 2 respectively) in the $\lephad$ channel, or the transverse momenta of the leading and trailing $\had$ candidates (referred to as particles 1 and 2 respectively) in the $\hadhad$ channel.
\item $\met$ $\phi$ centrality: a variable that quantifies the angular position of $\mpt$ relative to the visible $\tau$-lepton decay products in the transverse plane. It is defined as:
\begin{equation*}
\met\; \phi\; \mathrm{centrality} = \frac{\sin(\phi_\mathrm{miss}-\phi_1)+\sin(\phi_\mathrm{miss}-\phi_2)}{\sqrt{\sin^2(\phi_\mathrm{miss}-\phi_1)+\sin^2(\phi_\mathrm{miss}-\phi_2)}}
\end{equation*}
\noindent where $\phi_\mathrm{miss}$ denotes the azimuthal angle of $\mpt$, and $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ denote the azimuthal angles the two $\tau$-lepton candidates 
(the lepton and $\had$ candidate in the $\lephad$ channel, or the leading and trailing $\had$ candidates in the $\hadhad$ channel), referred to as particles 1 and 2 respectively.
\item $E_{\text{T},\parallel}^{\text{miss}}$: the magnitude of the projection of the original $\mpt$ vector parallel to the fitted $\mpt$ vector, minus 
the magnitude of the fitted $\mpt$ vector.
\item $E_{\text{T},\perp}^{\text{miss}}$: the magnitude of the projection of the original $\mpt$ vector perpendicular to the fitted $\mpt$ vector.
\item $m_{b j_1}$: the invariant mass of the $b$-jet and the leading jet candidate from the hadronically decaying $W$ boson.
\item $m_{\text{lep}j}$: the invariant mass of the lepton and the jet that has the smallest angular distance to the $\lep$ candidate.
\item $m_{\tau j}$: the invariant mass of the  $\had$ candidate and the jet that has the smallest angular distance to the $\had$ candidate.
\item $x_{1}^{\text{fit}}$ and $x_{2}^{\text{fit}}$: the momentum fractions carried by the visible decay products from the two $\tau$-lepton candidates 
(whether $\taulep$ or $\had$) per event. It is based on the best-fit four-momentum of the neutrino(s) according to the event reconstruction procedure outlined in Section~\ref{sec:htautau_reco_cat}.
\item $m_{bj_1j_2}$: the invariant mass of the $b$-jet and the two jets originating from the $W$ boson in the $t\to Wb \to j_1j_2b$ decay, corresponding to the reconstructed mass of the parent top quark. This variable is only defined for events with at least four jets.
\end{itemize}

Among these variables, the most discriminating are $m_{\tau\tau}^{\text{fit}}$, $p_{\text{T},2}$, $x_{1}^{\text{fit}}$ and $x_{2}^{\text{fit}}$. A comparison between data and the predicted background for some of these variables in each of the SRs considered is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:BDT_inputs_lephad} and~\ref{fig:BDT_inputs_hadhad}.
A good description of the data by the background model is observed in all cases.
The level of discrimination between signal and background achieved by the BDTs is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:BDT}.
