Dear Editor,

following the comments from the referee, the following changes were made on the manuscript:

Section 1, last second paragraph:
Added the recent published CMS tqHgammagamma results in Table 1 and text as:
"CMS also recently reported a search for $tqH$ in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ mode using the full Run-2 data and set observed(expected) upper limits on $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hu)$ of $1.9\times10^{-4}(3.1\times10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hc)$ of $7.3\times10^{-4}(5.1\times10^{-4})$ [36]."

Added reference [37].

Appendix A, end of 1st paragraph:
Added the following sentence:
"However, the interpretation of these scale factors is  difficult due to their large correlations."

The following figures are updated:
Figure 1 (i), Figure 2 (i), Figure 3 (f) (g) (i), Figure 4 (f) (g) (i), Figure 7 (d) (e) (f).

Best regards,

The ATLAS Collaboration
