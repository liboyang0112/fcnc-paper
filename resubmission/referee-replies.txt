Dear reviewer, 
thank you for your useful comments. They helped to improve the clarity of the paper and see our replies below. 

Best regards,

The ATLAS collaboration



The paper draft at hand discussed a thoroughly done search for flavour changing neutral current interactions of the top quark and the Higgs boson, with Higgs boson decays to tau leptons. The result is timely and improves significantly upon previous results in the channel, with similar sensitivity as a recent publication by the CMS Collaboration. The paper therefore certainly deserves publication when the comments given in the following are addressed. The CMS Collaboration has recently published a similar study using H- >gamma gamma decays, Phys. Rev. Lett. 129 (2022) 032001 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.02219). This result should be included in the discussion in the introduction.
----> Thanks and we have included the new CMS tqHgammagamma result in the revised paper as "CMS also recently reported a search for $tqH$ in the $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$ mode using the full Run~2 data and set observed(expected) upper limits on $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hu)$ of $1.9\times10^{-4}\, (3.1\times10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{B}(t\to Hc)$ of $7.3\times10^{-4}\, (5.1\times10^{-4})$~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-20-007}." as well as updated in Table 1.

Section 3, overlap removal: It seems a bit unusual that b-tagging takes precedence over hadronic tau decays and electrons. Given that taus have a finite lifetime, it seems plausible that jets from tau decays might be tagged as coming from a b quark decay, unless the b-tagging algorithm has been optimised not to. Is this the case?
----> Yes, this is correct. The btag working point  is used corresponding to an average  70% efficiency to tag a b-quark jet, with a light-jet rejection factor of about 385 and a charm-jet rejection factor of about 12. The efficiency of tagging the hadronic tau is about 2% or a rejection factor of about 49, which has a negligible impact on the overlap removal.

What is the impact of hadronic tau decays in the top decay on the SS selection?
----> We assume you are asking the impact of the tqH signal on the SS selection, right? 
In that case, the two taus with the SS are unlikely from the Higgs decay and have very different kinematics than the signal where two taus are from the Higgs decay. Their event BDT shape is more background-like as shown in Figure 3 and 4 (f) for lep2hadSS and (i) for hadhad-3j SS in the two most sensitive channels. So the impact on the background shape would be small in the SS regions. 

Section 7.1/Appendix A: Overall, the fake tau background estimation method appears to be very well thought-out given the large differences in jet-to-tau fake rates for different jet flavours and charges. A few questions on the method are given in the following list:

Difference between type 1/2 and 4: Are fake taus of type 4 supposed to mean taus from u/c-initiated (or flavoured) jets? Or is there a special significance of light-flavour hadron decays (strictly from the text, it sounds like the reconstructed tau might be matched to a light-flavoured hadron in a jet, but this does not seem plausible?)?
----> Type-4 fake tau-leptons are originated from light-flavor hadron decays from pile-up, u/c-jets, and ISR/FSR.

Table 9: For Type-2, is it plausible that the fake rate scale factor is 0.76+- 0.07 for 25 < pT < 35 GeV, 0.37+-0.08 for 35 < pT 45 GeV, and 0.74+-0.08 for pT > 45 GeV? What could cause the fake rate scale factor to be so much smaller for the intermediate pT range? The very low fake rate scale factor for Type-1 and pT > 45 GeV is also striking (also in table 10). Given the small statistical uncertainties, was it tried to derive the scale factor in more bins at high pT, to see if there is a consistent trend vs pT? What are causes of the fake rates being different between data and simulation?
----> That's a good question. The fake tau factores (FFs) should be smooth between pT bins.  Unfortunately, Type-1 and Type-2 are strongly correlated in the fits, which makes the interpretation of each FFs difficult. But these FFs do fix the discrepancies between the data and the Monte Carlo predictions in fakes. We also have checked FFs fits over the various detector systematics, which seems stable. At the end, the fake background model are validated in the SS validation regions. Added a warning at the end of Appendix "However, the interpretation of these scale factors is  difficult due to their large correlations."

Which uncertainties are considered in the fake rate scale factor fits?
----> All systematics listed in the text are considered in the fake rate scale factor fits in CRtt.  For each systematic, the FF fits are updated in CRtt and the corresponding FFs are used to correct the fake tau in simulation for the final BDT fits in the signal region. The impact on the signal strength are summarized over all systematics.

Fig. 7. bottom left and right plots: The error bars for data points with central vallues outside of the ratio panel are not drawn (they should extend into the panel) and should be added.
----> Thanks for the suggestion and the figures are updated to expand the ratio panel for including the outlier.

Fig 1 (d): The data/MC ratio decreases towards high tau pT, and it is not clear to which extent the uncertainty band covers for this ratio given that the uncertainty band also includes contributions that are (positively) correlated across bins, and may be dominating the bins. Is this trend covered by systematic uncertainties, and which have the largest shape effect? Was this distribution checked post-fit (with the fitted values of the systematic uncertainties taken from the BDT fit)?
----> The statement does not seem supported by other plots in Fig 1 where the data/MC ratio agrees towards high tau pT. The data in Fig 1 (d) are consistent within a sigma band of systematic uncertainties. The background is mainly coming from the fakes, especially from W-jet fakes and ttbar real tau contributions. The systematic impact is dominated by the pile-up, jet flavor composition, ttbar modeling, jet energy resolution, b-tagging, jet eta modeling, tau ID, and tau fake uncertainties. Yes, we did check the pull of NP after post-fit from the BDT fit, in which there is no significant pull found. 

Fig 1 (i): The last-but-one bin presumably has zero observed events. I would suggest to draw a marker and error bar also for zero entries, both in the main plot and the ratio panel.
---> Thanks for the suggestion and we will update the figure to add uncertainty of 1.83 for the zero entry bin by covering one-side of sigma. The plot is updated accordingly.

Fig 2 (i): For the 6th data point, I would have thought that the error bar should be visible in the ratio panel, while the data point is indeed beyond. Can this be added if this observation is correct?
----> Thanks for the suggestions. We have expanded the ratio panel to include the point.

Section 8 / BDT training: Were different sets of events used to train and evaluate the BDTs?
----> Yes, the events are divided half according to their event numbers in even/odd and one half is used in the training and the other half is used to evaluate the BDTs and vice versa.

Section 9.3: From the first few paragraphs, it sounds like PDF variations are only considered as uncertainties for the Z->tau tau samples, but not for the ttbar background. Is this understanding correct, and if yes, how is this motivated?
----> No, the same PDF variation procedures are applied to the other processes as well. We describe it for Z+jets since it has a significant impact on the Z+jets cross section, which is one of the dominated backgrounds in the all hadronic channels.
